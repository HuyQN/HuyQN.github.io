fAJOQYBA-vSPUfefXEA9_w,"My friend and I had a great experience at The Hulman last night. We were honestly a little concerned when we arrived to find that the restaurant was empty, but for one table. But our fears were quickly put to rest as we met our server, Franklin. He was efficient and knowledgeable, incredibly kind, and really on his game last night. And as the night went on, the bar and restaurant began to fill.We started with cocktails and a couple of starters. We really enjoyed the plentiful ""Gluten & Dairy"" (bread and butter) basket full of locally baked breads and amazing local butter, and the pickled vegetables. The drinks were great.I ordered the Shortrib Spaccatelli. It was amazing. A braised shortrib ragu tossed with spaccatelli pasta, and topped with crispy shaved Brussels sprouts and creamy ricotta. I could have eaten it all night. My friend ordered the Autumn Squash Mezzaluna, and it was equally as impressive. Whoever designed the space deserves raise. The furniture and decor are hip and trendy, and comfortable and cozy. I'd love to take the furniture home with me. We wandered into the lobby of the hotel to check it out and really enjoyed the nods to local history sprinkled throughout. It's a really cool space. My only suggestion would be to tone down the ""signature scent"" of the hotel in the restaurant area. The scent, though not a bad smell, was a little overpowering in places. Not unlike walking past Abercrombie in the mall and getting a huge whiff of cologne. It was a little off putting in the restaurant.Overall, we were really impressed with The Hulman and Hotel Indy. We'll be back!",i37jmCGwT4bJ45ATVF5JQw,2021-11-08 13:11:48,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Christine
i3-pvYfeo_UcXbJ4jgx6ng,"Great location; glad it expands the circle center even more. The menu may seem brief but don't let that deceive you, been for dinner and breakfast--both excellent. Happy to have a new brunch place. The staff is so nice! The inside is cool--modern classic feel. I do think this place hasn't been ""discovered"" yet as it hasn't been busy when I've been which I love but others should know about it. Gonna try to go often before it gets popular!",tcJam_pb7B7fquzZrMDodg,2021-12-31 02:51:14,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Melissa
zHyet5M5i6BTCln-wASDHw,"The staff was extremely attentive. We were a little lost attempting to find this on the lobby level of the hotel, but staff graciously guided us to a hostess and bar seating was readily available. From there, the bartenders were again very personable and talented. The drinks were delicious!The food, however, left much to be desired. Great presentation, but the flavor did not live up. Not sure if this is a seasonal menu, but certainly lots of winter vegetables incorporated into dishes, which require a bit more seasoning than was ultimately served. I would return here, however, for the drinks!",3nK_bdMK24Q_wlyNz-SGKw,2021-12-19 04:40:52,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,3,Kendra
xYtNFTtdwa79-IUNErRckg,"Do you ever visit a new restaurant and just know it's going to be one of your go-to's? That's how The Hulman was for me. I went the week after they opened, and immediately knew I needed to go back for my 30th Birthday. The staff is so helpful describing the dishes and making recommendations, and Executive Chef Patrick Russ is a true star. I mean, look at the incredible cake they made for my birthday! Miller's Amish Chicken--This beautiful dish has so many delicious textures and flavors that pair really well together, and it's Gluten Free!Grilled Oysters--The best presentation I've ever seen for oysters. If you don't normally love oysters, order these anyway. They are great. Brussels & Burrata--I will order this every time I visit. This dish is perfection. Autumn Squash Mezzaluna--Did you know they make their own pasta in-house?! Everything about this is cozy comfort food. I only wish it came with bread to soak up all the delicious leftover sauce at the end. The Hulman Burger--I didn't try this one myself, but multiple people at my table ordered it and said it was great!Millionaire--I love fruity & floral cocktails, and this one was fabulous. Wabash Old Fash--Very smooth and they even spritz it with gold! Bonus, it's 100% Hoosier-made!STP--I loved the hint of spice in this fruit-forward cocktail. Cookie Cake--This was the most wonderful and thoughtful surprise. My birthday falls on National Cookie Day, so they made me this gorgeous cake. It was definitely the best frosting I've ever had too! I am beyond thankful that they made my birthday so special.",8sJwRsTD-X2RZdAW1AfqtQ,2022-01-07 14:16:27,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Traci
cioA3Ic-i6fFA3Ukp47liA,"I wandered in on opening night with my husband b/c they had valet parking.  the staff was eager to please and we'll dressed. The decor was cool- mid 50's modern. The bartender was knowledgeable and upbeat. We had the charcuterie board, lobster bisque, citrus salad and for entree's, the flat iron steak and the salmon- each dish was flawless. They undoubtedly have a great chef. Really, great food!My only suggestion (since they are new) would be that they dim the lights for the dinner crowd- but that's an easy fix. Bravo! I can't wait to go back.",zhi1Zhb39mudecIEGoFVmw,2021-10-28 01:01:13,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Meredith
6N2OJwxG8ENzeAJS0klJzA,"I went here on a Tuesday night before a concert. I was able to easily find parking across the street on Washington and the person I was meeting found parking right in front of the hotel. We had a reservation and I arrived first and was quickly greeted and seated by a host. I was immediately impressed by the overall ambiance and decor of the space. Everything from the mid century modern inspired bar to the sofas and chairs were stylish and I could tell a lot of detail went into designing the restaurant. Once seated, a waiter welcomed me and handed me a menu. I ordered a drink while I waited for my friend. Once she arrived she ordered the same drink, which we both enjoyed. Our only complaint was that there was too much ice in it. Ultimately, we opted for a couple of appetizers and entrees to share and loved them all (the first entree I requested they were out of). The plating of each dish was beautiful. I'd say portions are small, so beware of that. Everything tasted fresh and light (nothing too heavy or greasy) with a deep mixture of flavors. All the options are creative and have multiple standout ingredients. I look forward to returning here to try more dishes. The only reason I'm giving this place a 4 is due to them running out of an entree on a Tuesday night and both my friend and I being charged twice by our waiter. The issue was ultimately resolved but it is a bit annoying to look at your bank account and see a double charge. Despite the mistake, I highly recommend visiting the Hulman and our waiter was still great!",j7QHFb_7N2PTz0XW6kED3Q,2021-12-22 03:32:01,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,4,Antonia
o4w0rM6P7tYnR1jom5vDUQ,"The Hulman has been open for less than a morn, their menu looked great so we decided to try it. It is located in the new Marriot property on Washington St. The Decors was very light and airy, it was a little loud in the restaurant part, but the bar seemed not as loud. Once you got used to it it was OK.The menu is exceptional. Who ever the Chef is is someone who is offering things we have never had in Indy. Not the normal steak and Seafood p0lace...but the Alaskan Crab Bisque is with out a doubt the best Bisque I have ever had. The table presentation was fun and on spot. The menu isn't real big, but thats ok Had the Chappino it was really exceptional my friend has the skirt steak, ut wa off the charts. Also. The Earl Grey creme Brûlée' was great,  perfect balance. The service was very good, and the staff seems to like working there. Really like it, wil be back for that Alaskan Crab Bisque.....its the new St. Elmos Shrimp Contail in Indy.",Htpdw5Ny7Rad5oyS1ma1Cw,2021-12-12 04:40:30,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Blair
w9JpDxXtge9sDATVmnA4yA,I love the Hulman!! Our server was Lauren and she was amazing. She was super knowledgeable about the menu and was able to make a handful of awesome recommendations for us. We tried all of her recommendations  they were AMAZING. The decor of the place was super fun and the drinks were yummy. I really loved the grilled oysters and would highly suggest getting them. I'm soooo excited to welcome the hulman to the city!! Such a huge win for Indianapolis.,ilnY_7-JtM0OBjHWnCaHTA,2021-11-13 12:54:13,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Denae
oh1jgtYlgqGBEhTdPi29FA,"First time coming to The Hulman and Jessica was the sweetest server! She told us about the history of The Hulman and kept the conversation short, sweet, but informative. The atmosphere of the restaurant was amazing! So much detail and Indy related items everywhere. Last, the food was *chef kiss* - I ordered the eggplant sandwich with a side of pickled veggies, just to go outside of my norm, and I'm so glad I did! Can't wait to come back again!",kN3CuOTk2jGbk7EC3wPCuQ,2021-11-13 05:03:46,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Kylee
dGSBoQmsSSQSsn0_kexdfA,"My husband and I and several family members were excited to dine at The Hulman after reading the great reviews! We started the evening ordering several small plates which were shareable with 2-3 adults so for a larger party I would adjust that. The Shaved Beet and Citrus Salad paired nicely with the Black Truffle Arancini and the Moroccan Spiced Meatballs which were a great start to our evening.  With the small plates we all ordered craft cocktails, local spirits, and ""mocktails"", all reasonably priced and creatively named for Indy icons and events. Onto the entrees,  the Ora King Salmon, the Autumn Squash Mezzaluna, and the Prime Flat Iron did not disappoint!!   All the food is locally inspired and very creative!The Grilled Oysters are to ""die for""! They are served on a pan of smoked wood chips topped with lemongrass, Fresno chili, cilantro-lime butter slap sauce. They were so good we had 3 orders for our table!!After all this, dessert, the homemade ice creams/ sorbets were tasty and the churro was !!!Loved the food, ambience, and excellent service!! Looking forward to my next visit, breakfast? Lunch?",WNgpvkyxFjQEJmETsSmAiA,2021-11-09 04:40:00,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Sally

ZsTrh2QYU1Fq1NWSDYR7OQ,"Beautiful new restaurant on the first floor of Hotel Indy. Decor is very modern yet comfortable. Unfortunately, due to widespread staffing issues, they did not have a bartender this day. Otherwise, service was excellent. I had the veggie omelette. It was delicious. The potatoes hash was superb. Very Instagram-able ambiance. Highly recommend.",xlsLFgRKb91mG0XFh1aDLA,2021-11-08 20:07:13,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Patrick
Pp3PHzpWy3g1fAfix2cokg,"I've been here several times since it opened and given the ""newness"" of the place, it's been a different experience each time. First of all the menu and food is great. I haven't gotten a dish there I didn't love. My favs are the fried oysters and brussel sprout app. Not surprisingly, the service has been varied and I can only assume that will improve with time. The first time we ate there we got all 5 things we ordered within 10 mins so that is clearly something they needed to work through. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and if nothing else go to the bar and get a drink (with a side of the brussel sprout app)!!",5TE19zTjTIPq1HANACN7sw,2021-12-28 12:30:44,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,4,Carla
A9Obe00HqIACELiU_XuKsA,"Cool new spot that needs to iron out a few wrinkles. The service here is abysmal, front of house is inexperienced and incompetent. Decor is 5 stars, Food was 4 stars (good value) but service deserves 0 so I'll call 3 it stars. Decor is amazing, retains an Art Deco  feel of the 50s. The light over the island bar is a massive orb that flows well with the beautiful concrete ceilings. The furniture in on point. Come here for the architecture alone, it's dope.Don't come here for the service. It's slow and they don't like clearing tables (biased because I bussed tables in my youth). On a Saturday night, drinks took 30 minutes & came after appetizers (which also took a while). No plates were cleared until the very end of the meal & the tables aren't very big.Food was 4 stars. The oysters were overpowered by a sweet (Asian) glaze but I enjoyed them and the charcoals were a cool presentation. Good value at $20 per 6. The rice balls were decent albeit small and tasted almost Trader Joe's from an air fryer, order multiple (each person will want 2). I love pickles so I got pickled vegetables while my girlfriend had the Mousse, these hit the spot. Everything turned out decent, albeit the cheese in my girlfriend's short rib was still cold. Back of house is way more squared away but not quite there yet... hoping this is a soft open? Pro-tip: the bathrooms are by the elevators, signage isn't good",5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw,2021-11-07 03:18:01,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,3,Roger

Swanky music vibe with mid century modern design. The burger was actually really good!! My husband is a burger guy and loved it! Next time I think I will try the skirt steak! Very clean! We made reservations but probably didn't need them! Just getting started so give them a try! Eat local! Enjoy!! We also stayed at the hotel. Very nice!!! Comfy!

BlbxT6krDl164ReJaTRqfg,"Let me first say, the food and the décor of this restaurant is not what you think of when you hear ""hotel restaurant"" although it's located in a pretty cool hotel.  The hotel that just opened late October 2021 has a mid-centaury décor and is themed ""All Things Indy"", including giving a nod to Indianapolis celebrities and its history.  The restaurant is named after Tony Hulman (who bought the Indianapolis Speedway in 1945 and coined the starting command ""Gentlemen, start your engines!"") and the affiliated rooftop bar, The Cannonball Lounge (winner of the 1909 Indianapolis first motorized race, Cannon Ball Baker) has a beautiful view of downtown Indy from their open-air bar.  I would recommend if you have the time, make a night of it by going to both, either cocktails before dinner or after dinner dinks. My wife and I, our adult daughter, her two young sons, my son and his fiancé all decided to go to The Hulman a couple of weeks after it opened after hearing all the hype in the local news and social media.  I mention all the participants to show the scope of the menu that can satisfy many tastes and preferences. No One was disappointed. The table decided to start with the Grilled Oysters, Gluten & Dairy, and the meat and cheese Charcuterie Board for appetizes.  It may seem odd to order bread and butter but this is locally baked artisan bread and creamy butter, well worth the price.  The charcuterie board had a very nice variety of delicious cured meats and cheeses.  But I left the best for last.  The grilled oysters were amazing.  Even family members who never tried oysters or who had tried oysters and didn't like them (my grandson) loved these. A definite must have.  After reviewing the menu, I decided to go with a verity of small plates;  the Roasted Beet Carpaccio, the Moroccan Spiced Meatballs, and the Steak Tartare.  All were outstanding.  My wife had the King Salmon, my daughter had the Autumn Squash Mezzaluna (her new favorite dish), the grandkids got the flat iron steak and the Hulman burger (leftovers went home to dad) and my son split the Amish chicken with his fiancé.  All were beautifully presented andreally delicious.  Everyone were very complimentary of the food throughout the meal. Because of the kids, we couldn't make it to the Cannon Ball lounge (we went up to take a peek) but my wife and I are planning to return this week and do both. The Hulman is highly recommended.",xxhhMne3m_MCC2fmiHZSSw,2021-11-10 04:44:20,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,The
QkBQ6n06ViWMZWg6knvfVg,"Exceptional food!  Ambiance was great and service was ok too.

2fEuyYJYXj-x-G60nMcSYA,"The 'Hotel Indy' recently opened, last October, with the addition of 'The Hulman', inside.  The restaurant faces East Washington Street.  Also, Washington Street is a one way, so you might have to pass it, several times.  There is parking on the street and a parking garage across from the restaurant.  'The Hulman' is named after the Hulman-George family, Tony Hulman Jr., who purchased the 'Indianapolis Motor Speedway', back in 1945 to prevent the track from closing.  You can also make reservations online on Opentable.com.  There wasn't much of a crowd, on a Friday night.  The restaurant has spacious seating, with low leather booths.  I was really looking forward to dining at 'The Hulman', after I read a review for it, in 'Indianapolis Monthly' (January '22) by their dining editor, Julia Spalding.Ordered off the 'Dinner' menu'-SMALL-'Roasted Beet Carpaccio'(kohlrabi, chicory, tahini yogurt, hazelnuts)-LARGE-'Miller's Amish Chicken'(tabouleh, romesco hummus, kalamata olive, marcona almonds)All of 'Patrick Russ' dishes, are crafted from locally sourced ingredients.  I was hoping to catch a glimpse of the chef but I was rather, disappointed.  After dinner, I ordered 'Dessert', 'Churro' with ice cream with a 'Latte'.",ilNIxHpVBggkj8_HL9Dz5Q,2022-01-18 06:27:51,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Fahad

Note: We dined on NYE and had my son with me.  We gad just been to Pacers game and he had a Jersey on (He's 10) and the numerous staff members asked him about the game and made him feel really important!

I love though the menu was small, you could order breakfast or lunch. I opted for the southern crawfish Benedict and it was delicious. $16 price point isn't too steep considering the atmosphere and it was a good size dish. Staff was friendly as well. I will definitely be back to check out more!",Qw28LOGr4IitwwgqvnSlww,2022-01-13 14:53:08,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,5,Taylor
G3_bpqBL-5rNRlZoOOzF6A,"The Hulman is a new spot in downtown Indy, located inside of Hotel Indy. Named after Indy Motor Speedway owner, Anton Hulman, there are several nods to his legacy in the decor. The bar is in the shape of the track, the checkered flag flooring, and pictures of scenes from IMS are all great touches to carry the theme through. They have a breakfast, lunch, and dinner menu, with a special brunch menu on the weekends. We stopped by for brunch. I ordered the crawfish Benedict. It came out like a crab cake, which I wasn't expecting, but still tasty nonetheless. I could definitely have used more of their potatoes, they were delicious.They have a full bar, huge cocktail and wine list, there's something for everybody. However I don't remember seeing a specific mimosa on the menu, so we ordered a bottle and some juice. They had only been open for two weeks when we stopped in, so there were some obvious kinks that still needed to be worked out. One being they were out of some things that we ordered. This still has the potential to be a great addition to the Indy food scene.",hL8Os05NS3en1OWRgj-TSw,2021-12-03 09:19:34,yihYQeo1YN6chq7uBtk7mQ,4,Shawniece
