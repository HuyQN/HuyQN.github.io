Although the other food looks amazing, I cannot resist that BLT, so I will be back!!",NkgvGL4p5cvWG_CHk7yJpA,2021-12-04 20:37:05,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Julia
xfBsxB4J96HAB6OSA60HUw,"I absolutely love Slapfish, and since the raw bar is owned by the same people and attached to the Slapfish on Mass ave we decided to try it. A little different than Slapfish,  as this is a sit down restaurant not order at the counter. Our waitress seemed a little stand offish at first and it seemed like it took a little long for our appetizers to come out, (the restaurant was not busy, as we got there early) but once we ordered dinner everything seemed to be on track. I was a little disappointed with the lack of flavor in my burrito. Not a great first experience, however, I'm willing to go back and try another dish simply because I've been so happy with everything I've ever ordered from Slapfish along with the service!",kdUnqQGfvMqNTN2UyVjFwQ,2021-12-13 19:43:35,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,4,Andrea
pwgn5P-RuWfLpgmMFneGAg,Had dinner here last night and really enjoyed it. There were about 12 of us and our server was Amie who did an awesome job. Several other staff helped keep an eye on us and the evening went really smoothly.  There are plenty of great options but definitely start with some of the raw oysters! They come with 3 different sauces. The bowl of clam chowder was probably the largest I've seen and got excellent reviews. I had the poke which was fresh with large chunks. It came with tortilla chips and it would have been nice to have a greens or seaweed salad option but that's just a personal taste. Others had the lobster avocado toast and lobster press. Everyone was happy with their meals and want to come back to try more. There is quite a variety of fun specialty drinks and beers to try as well.We had a birthday in our party and staff went out of their way to come up with a surprise dessert of bread pudding with ice cream. They don't have a dessert menu so we really appreciate them going above and beyond for a great evening!,ZLBWZaDQ0yYkNK9dfDYwpg,2021-12-08 19:31:57,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Laura
9wB1dLnhWOIqsag5KiuL6w,"Was so excited to try this with my girlfriend! Very fun & modern aesthetic/vibe to the place. We went on a Thursday evening during their soft opening and it was somewhat busy but not packed. Service was slow...we were there for probably an hour and a half / almost two hours in total. Our waitress seemed very distracted training another employee but then she was also just kind of standing behind the bar so I was confused. We didn't place our order until sitting for probably 45minutes. Which isn't a big deal since I was with a friend and we were enjoying our time but still something they should work out probably.Redemption season....Food was excellent. Lobster Tots were delish. Picture a fried Mac and cheese ball but a crab cake (lobster) filling. With their 'awesome sauce'. They were indeed awesome I don't do oysters but my friend had 3 different types, both from west coast and east coast and she enjoyed them all. We also had the Lobster Press and lobster Mac and cheese, and salads and it was bomb!! Will be back for sure, hoping they can smooth out the service kinks!!",N2pRk2AVnOLWSD-5GKvOyA,2021-11-19 15:49:51,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,4,Marissa
rGecxr13-M6UvIIB30sOBw,All I can say is wow! This place being such a hit should come as no surprises since Slapfish is so great but I was very pleased with my experience. Had the opportunity to try raw bar for brunch and had a blast. The food was amazing and the drinks did not disappoint. The atmosphere and setting is also super appealing. This restaurant has an overall great vibe to it & I absolutely can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. My only suggestions would be maybe adding some music. This place would be so fun with good tunes playing while we chow on our seafood. Also our server seemed pretty annoyed and it took forever just to get water but it was a pretty busy so I'll give them a pass. Do yourself a favor and plan your next outing at raw bar!,GvqO4NpNYIUoiTgWkEUgBQ,2021-12-06 04:23:15,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Shakara
-s8xMKFF2L3HOGrzxA32vQ,"On Wednesday I enjoyed the lobster roll next door at Slapfish. With friends in tow we ventured next door into the full service Raw Bar and were thrilled.On a sleepy Sunday night before a concert, we started with interesting cocktails, lobster deviled eggs and oysters. We appreciated the artful presentation and taste. The huge bowl of clam chowder was one of the best I've ever had. The wedge with shrimp was huge with plenty of shrimp and taste. If I had a complaint it would be that the servings were large despite a small plate billing and price.  It was a terrific dinner, delightful service and an enjoyable evening!",q8uRrEuV_nwa-G5Gjo1hRA,2021-11-08 00:13:42,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Sally
i3aQsOe3Sshs2k4w15cIWA,"So I thought it would come here Saturday and try their brunch. It was about twenty degrees out that morning and I got to the restaurant at about 11:15. There was one other table in the restaurant when I got there. I did find that their hours were longer than I thought so that was a good thing. They were open until midnight! So there was no need to hurry to finish.Since the restaurant was empty they just told me pick where I wanted to sit so I sat up front by the windows. It was a very beautiful restaurant.My waitress came to the table with water service and was attentive and answered what questions I had. I decided to order the Mimosa flight and the lobster omelette.For the Mimosa flight I ordered the passion fruit, cranberry rosemary, the pear ginger, and the bellini. It was nice to sit and gaze out the windows onto Mass Avenue and enjoy my cocktails.My lobster omelette came in it was accompanied by thin sliced potatoes and some steamed tomatoes. The potatoes were definitely greasy and didn't think the tomato was needed. The lobster omelette was perfectly cooked and had plenty of lobster in it. I would have liked a nice crunchy bread with butter on the side along with that fluffy omelette.It did take me a little longer to finish my cocktails but finish them I did. My favorite was the Raw Bar Bellini and it consisted of champagne peach liqueur and peach puree. My least favorite was the cranberry rosemary it was just a little too tart for me. I will be back in to try it again.",INQotNgqr7-Q8e2o7X0uBA,2022-01-18 22:29:46,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,4,Tyanna
CcT1Q5aJ7Ckxnt4KFrsQ_A,"This is by far the best raw bar I've been to in the Midwest. No exaggeration. The oyster menu was divine, and the brunch menu incorporated other seafood like lobster and crab seamlessly. I was extremely impressed, and this is coming from a native Floridian!

Y-8La7_lk6kHp3yCaCCUlg,"Whenever I want seafood I know I can always count on slapfish to be my go to place. Everything is always so fresh here and they do a great job at creating unique menu items (lobster avocado toast? I'm in!) While the raw bar menu is a little smaller than the normal slapfish menu, there is still something for all seafood lovers. I loved the decor of the inside and was happy to see this location on mass ave! We decided on an early dinner and the restaurant was pretty quiet so if you don't have a reservation, get there early because it got busy as the evening went on. The only thing holding me back from the 5 star was the service. Our waitress didn't seem too interested in serving us and mentioned grabbing everything in one visit so she wouldn't have to come back. I don't think she meant it in an intentional bad way but it kind of came across like that just with the initial service. Overall the food was good, as always, and it will continue to be my seafood recommendation to others!",wmdDs2XtJGp1NDWocZDPaw,2021-12-16 18:38:38,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,4,Lauren
d4TcSfwyATWdkOngpy0nEg,"The Raw Bar by Slapfish sits right next-door to the Slapfish restaurant. There is a walk-through between the restaurants, but each has they're very own unique setting and menu. We have been anticipating the opening, since we are big fans of Slapfish and did not realize when we came by this week that it was their soft opening week. Everything was amazing! We will be back regularly as there is really nothing that compares in Indy. Seafood is very fresh, the atmosphere is trendy, service was amazing, and the food and drinks are awesome!We started out with two cocktails: the Indiana 75 which had hints of lavender and dried lavender sprinkled on top. It was herbaceous and slightly sweet and my husband really enjoyed it. I opted for the Corpse Reviver #2, even though I hesitated because it had absinthe in it. The waitress checked with the bar manager  and quickly assured me that it was not overly heavy with licorice flavor and that it was only slightly sweet, but also tart drink. I am so glad I ordered it! The bar manager's description was spot on and this is one of the best cocktails I've had. My husband and I shared the Clobster cakes which were nice sized crab and lobster cakes that were not full of filler. These cakes were full of meat! They came out warm with a really nice aïoli type sauce and were bigger than we were expecting! We also had the sweet shrimp Arancini. Crispy balls of rice and shrimp fried with a sweet soy type sauce on the side. It also came with a cabbage salad that was also sweet and creamy with some crunchy bits in it. This will be something I definitely order over and over. The flavors were unbelievable. Last, we got a smoked fish plate. Let me tell you, I am from Canada and we eat a lot of fresh, homemade smoked fish right from the water. Although they don't smoke it in the house, they clearly by the best of the best. The smoked salmon and other white fish that came on the plate were perfectly smoked and in a nice portion. They came served with a nice stone ground mustard, aioli, pickled onions and caper berries - as well as crostini. My husband almost ordered another plate, but we were pretty full. We can't wait to come back and eat oysters. They had six types that they will shuck on the spot. They also have their signature lobster roll and a few other items that are available next-door at Slapfish, but ultimately this place offers a whole new menu that is more in line with dinner type options.The atmosphere is really pretty and trendy. It's not a large restaurant, but they do have a bar as well as at least one table that seats approximately 6 to 8 people.",ItrM5BrIRsEr_pSAzM7Gcw,2021-11-05 21:10:00,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Angie
F9u2GERjoEHEtyr2G9PB-g,"We saw a promo for this place on the local news.  There was a brief interview with the owner and it looked interesting.So later I found out it's a franchise.  I prefer to visit actual local restaurants but we already plopped $2.00 in the parking meter so we went  ahead.When we got there, at 4 PM (don't be a hater), the placemat menu was the weekend brunch.  Oops.  I guess that the only table that was occupied flummoxed them and they were incapable of switching out the other 15 (?) table's menus in a timely manner.  Always love to hear my server's first words to be ""Oops"" while they scramble to get us a current menu.The menu lists a very large selection of oysters but only four were available.  East coast versus west cost mollusks, but no one bothered to explain the difference or why we should care.The wine list includes a local winery's selection for a price of $28 per bottle (something I can purchase at the local Target for $7).Our selections (for two of us) were the lobster cocktail, the house made pickles, the shrimp wedge and the linguini and clams.  None of these are cheap, by the way.  And no one asked how we wanted this served.I guess I shouldn't have been surprised when (almost) everything arrived at the table at one time.  The pickles didn't come with everything.  They never showed up.I asked where the shrimp were sourced from and the wait person had to ask a bar person who then went to the kitchen and I was later told they were sustainably sourced from Indonesia.  Sure they were.There appeared to be a manager but his only duties seemed to be to stand behind the bar sipping a drink and walking to the adjacent Slapfish location.  He never visited any table nor enquired as to the satisfaction of any patron.Bottom line:  you wanna suck down a few oysters?  It's probably one of the few choices you have in this town.But this is not someplace I would yearn to return.  No one wore a mask.  No manager came to our table.  It was a ""one and done"".On the plus side they failed to charge me for my soda.  Silver lining I guess.",N70iKTBt-HMd8huiTmMQNg,2022-01-09 02:02:46,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,2,Victoria
0rwU2uJMeFUXbwpcOwOGpw,"My favorite new eatery in downtown Indy! Solid service (thanks Alexis!!!), food is delightful while also a terrific value, decor is adorable, seating is comfortable & spacious for the location. Our dinner during the soft open was perfect! Menu has all the staples, I steered clear of the raw food because I was craving fried food but I'll report back. Tonight my girlfriend and I ordered clam chowder, fried oysters  & a power burrito with fries. Everything was simple and well executed! The fried oysters retained their flavor through a nice crispy batter & the ""awesome sauce"" complemented spectacularly. My girlfriend loved the chowdah, and we both found the power burrito to be healthy & satisfying. The fries are nicely seasoned and they come with some awesomely heavy ketchup.Pro tip- ask for a table in the front for solid people watching & ask for extra awesome sauce!",5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw,2021-12-02 02:37:44,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Roger
Vv6LahXDRcs14nX2pXO8hA,"Absolutely love this joint! Made my way back post soft opening and the quality & service were still every bit as awesome! Baked oysters are very flavorful! Calamari was battered perfectly with a nice crunch but not too greasy! The linguine and clams were my favorite from this visit! The broth has a lot of clams in shell and out, loads of flavor but not greasy or thick.",5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw,2021-12-22 01:51:40,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Roger
_yp7nljRlRrsq_wusMoaWA,"We were excited to try the Raw Bar. We are big seafood fans and are always happy when a new spot opens in Indy. We started with the peel and eat shrimp and the crab claws. We were very pleased with the freshness and flavor of both. He was a little disappointed in the size of the claws. They were pretty small. I had the linguini and clams and he had the steamed clams (they were out of mussels). Both were reasonably priced and tasty. He had an Indiana which was similar to a French 75 and was a fan. Overall we were pleased with what we got for the price, though next time we will skip the crab claws.",1OIgrA0fLHOxvRCsPjKdYw,2021-12-11 02:58:28,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Claire
5lGx7KwFnKXKN1cHTBjpFw,"Visited Raw Bar by Slapfish for brunch this weekend after they posted about their brunch Bloody Mary on Instagram. I have not been to this restaurant for dinner so I can only speak to their brunch menu and my experience. Overall, the brunch experience was OK. I felt that the restaurant opened for brunch, with a brunch-inspired menu, to bring in additional income during the weekends. Overall, the menu didn't offer much from their normal raw bar menu, other than items like lobster omelets and some dishes that included shrimp. I opted for the french toast which was great. My fiance got the steak and eggs. The steak was overly charred and chewy, and they didn't have gravy as listed on the menu. However, the steak and eggs dish was comped - and it was much appreciated. The Bloody Mary advertised was ok. It's $8 for just the drink, an additional $7 if you want the fixings. There's a decent mimosa deal as well, including a mimosa flight. Staff was friendly and service was attentive. Overall, I understand this place didn't open with the intention of offering brunch, and it's not their main focus. I'm definitely going to visit Raw Bar for dinner and will update this review.",8a6fVNqw00qUNlRcU4Zjow,2022-01-10 16:53:37,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,3,Kristen

trX0u9t8P429Jz0vsIFpYg,"This is one of my favorite new seafood places, let me tell you why! As soon as you walk in you'll probably say ""wow"" out loud at the ambiance. Plenty of lighting for your selfies and group photos, top notch high quality decor and seating and of course, a neon lit oyster. As you make your way to the bar area you can't help but notice the elegance of the layout. You'll be greeted by friendly smiles and great service for sure. When you check out the menu you'll notice plenty of cocktails and beers on tap and wines. Plenty of appetizers and fresh oysters to try for days and quaint seafood menu that won't take a long time to get through. I tried the lobster roll, lobster mac and cheese, lobster deviled eggs and the shrimp salad...all 5 stars in my book. I tried a raw oyster for the first time and couldn't do it lol. Next time it will be cooked for sure lol.

FXTO4GOcAgmj2yZFVIW7QQ,"Came here on a whim while walking around looking for a place to get some drinks while on our last day in Indy. So glad we stopped by they were still freshly opened  but they definitely had everything together. We sat at the bar and ordered some drinks (they have a nice selection of liquor and at a very reasonable price). We decided to order an oyster sampler to try the ones they had at that time (6 different kinds). They were all nice, fresh, and delicious def recommend them and the cool little added feature to the sampler (which I would've never tried but our awesome bartender pointed it out) was that the greens that garnished the sampler were called sea beans tasty and nice addition. The sampler also came with 3 different sauces (the habanero sauce is amazing). We also ended up ordering some oyster shooters a def must but make sure to get them the original way with the Bloody Mary mix. Overall very cool little spot wish we could've tried their food (we already had lunch) but would definitely recommend this place to the locals that have never been or people visiting looking for fresh oysters.",t3lcG05swX5sACfmU8r5jQ,2021-11-24 18:28:39,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Michael

We had so many good eats, raw oysters that were so delicious, they have many options of oysters but i said surprise me and loved what they picked out for me.We also had fresh delicious shrimp, with great cocktail sauce.The lobster Mac is tasty and just all around good, some of the best that I have had in the city.We also had arachini which was fluffy and flavorful.

8WWb7c0uw79kN9eg2UILrg,"This was an all around great experience. As usual I was dragging about a dozen guests with me and it wasn't a problem at all. While you will not be able to push tables together here, you can still sit together at various tables near each other. The interior is modern yet warm and welcoming. I am in love with all those lamps. It's is bright yet not blinding in here. The staff is very helpful and makes you feel at home almost. Service was great. Attentive without hovering, which is a definite skill.I had the pleasure of tasting the poke and chips to start with. Beautiful presentation. The chips are sprinled with some sort of flavor that packs a bit of heat. The poke is nicely seasoned and melts in your mouth. What a great start to a meal. I opted for the lobster press on recommendation of the staff. I am glad I did. This sandwich is huge and filled to the rim with lobster goodness. The filling is absolutely delish and it has one of the heat building qualities. It starts out harmless enough, but by the time I was through my first half, i could feel the heat and I liked it. The bread of this sandwich is perfect also, crunchy on the outside and buttery soft on the inside. As if you could ask for more, the sandwich comes with a side and while it says fries or salad on the menu, we were told we could choose any of the sides listed. I chose the salad. Again, beautiful presentation and exceptional taste. One of my guests enjoyed a 'small' portion of the Lobster mac and cheese and she was over the moon. I really liked the looks of it, with a little split lobster tail on top.The smoked fish appetizer also looked tasty and was deemed as such by my guests. I did notice that the bowls of soup are huge. So if you'd like to eat a bucket of soup, go with the bowl instead of the cup. Also a word to the cocktails... very innovative, very Instagramm worthy, very tasty... and the Storm Warning comes with a lemon drop in the bottom of the glass.I don't give many 5 star reviews, but Raw Bar earned this one.",7RlmJFtraL6HqNMlHvnmsA,2021-12-08 11:56:08,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,5,Sigrid
MoC30Klamy5zVrG_xHmH3A,"This meal was sublime. I walked by with 2 friends who had never tried oysters, so I said ok guys, I'll  buy us a round so you can try them, if y'all don't like it, we'll go somewhere else. 3 hours later we stumbled out of there having tried 2/3 of the menu, stuffed to the gills and grinning from ear to ear. Every single bite (and sip: great beer menu!) was tremendous, from the 6 different oysters to choose from, appetizers with everything that swims, sandwiches oozing with crab, lobster, and cheese, and palate cleansing finishers with smoked fish and creative pickles. To match the food, our waitress was also impeccable, super friendly, fun and engaging, and incredibly helpful, especially since my buddies had never tried most of the food there. 11/10 experience, best food we had in our whole week's stay in Indianapolis.

8G44cD5EprDsP6-OV5o5TQ,"I was really excited to try this spot since we enjoyed Slapfish when it first opened. I made a reservation on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. The staff was nice and we waited about 5 mins to be seated, no problem.Because I love seafood I try to order a variety of items off the menu. We ordered a lot of food and a few cocktails. The cocktails were really good but the food lacked flavor which was a total disappointment. A lot of the dishes needed salt along with some fresh herbs or spices.The clam chowder was my favorite at Slapfish when it first opened. This time when I had it it wasn't as hearty and this also lacked flavor. I asked for cracked pepper but our waitress was so busy I ate it before it got cold.I was initially excited to try the lobster Mac and cheese and the deviled eggs. The Mac and cheese was nothing but cheesy cheese and a little soupy and we basically sent it all back. The top has a nice crust (with potato chips... ummmm) but it wasn't truly baked or seasoned when you dig into it. I can't even call it a cultural thing with how they prepared it because I've been to other restaurants that had a better lobster Mac.The lobster deviled eggs sounds like a great idea but the flavors (to me) didn't come together. The pictures on Yelp made me want to try it because it looked so yummy. The layers were all good separate but together there wasn't a new taste or pop of flavor.Their food looks great in pics but again it lacked flavor. If we ever go back we will just go for the oysters on the half shell with some beer or cocktails. Keep it simple and stick with the basics! For all we spent (around $190) we only finished our drinks, the eggs and oysters... everything else was a waste. I guess it wasn't alarming to the staff or our waitress. She asked me about the Mac and cheese and I told her I wasn't a fan. Her response? That's fair. Our waitress seemed really busy (forgot our drink orders) but she was really nice. This place is great for oysters... go for the oysters and the seafood tower. It's fresh and it's nothing creative. I love the ambiance and the seating. Being downtown is also a plus.",L4icz2Fyefwuetk_XzSyCw,2021-12-22 19:16:10,4ihK-CfFXNVIxN_twd63ZQ,3,Yiesha
7QOoO4MFc0DF-EH8sLeNWg,"My husband and I visited Raw Bar to celebrate a birthday and really enjoyed this new addition to Mass Ave. The restaurant was pretty empty on a Sunday evening, so we got to choose where to sit. We chose a cozy booth by the window but you can also sit at the bar or a high-top table. The cocktail menu features many local spirits and ingredients. I opted for the Indiana 75, which was terrific. To start, we ordered some raw oysters, crab claws, and the smoked fish plate. The smoked fish plate came out first and we LOVED it. The fish pieces were a little small, but it all tasted very fresh. The oysters were meaty and good, but the crab claws were a bit small. The dipping sauces that came with the oysters and claws were great, so we saved some to use with our entrees. My husband got the steamed clams, which were served over pasta with a white wine and garlic sauce. The bite I had was really good. I ordered the lobster roll, which is the same as they serve next door at Slapfish. It was excellent! The fries served with it were also good.
