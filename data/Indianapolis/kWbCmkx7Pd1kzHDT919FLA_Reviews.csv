q0KpsjH6phGmeZa8lMInUA,"When I read there was a New Mexican restaurant in town that had some Mexican street food I had to check it out. When I arrived I realized it is the old Tortas Guicho Dominguez restaurant. I asked if the owners were the same and the server told me it was new owners, but they kept some of the same tortas and concepts. The outside of the building looks beautiful with that fresh coat of white paint and the inside is even more impressive! They put more stained glass inside to match the original on the building and I love that! They also arranged the seats in a more inviting way and gave the bar a really nice update. The whole place was very esthetically pleasing. The cheese sauce was wonderful! Thick and nicely flavored! Probably the best cheese sauce I've had. The chips were homemade, which was a nice treat. They were also delicious! I tried the torta ahogada. I hd never had one before and wanted to check it out. I was pleasantly surprised that the bread wasn't too soggy. The sauce was flavorful and the carnitas were seasoned well. My friend ordered an alambre and really liked it as well. I'm happy to have a another great Mexican restaurant in Fountain Square!",fiGSeA6Cew0IfPy0w2IZMg,2022-01-15 01:51:16,kWbCmkx7Pd1kzHDT919FLA,5,Bridget

I went for the Sofia Vergara, and it took all my will to save half for later. The interior is welcoming and cheery! Service was superb. Can't wait to go back to try something else!",8G_cfwhAlpFO09s3s1m8Nw,2022-01-11 18:42:11,kWbCmkx7Pd1kzHDT919FLA,5,Jena

iMvPcgrQAzpRkomr2PwujQ,"""Once upon a time there was a magical, Mexican restaurant in Fountain Square.  Nestled on the corner of Virginia Avenue and Stevens Street, La Eskina appeared one winter day and proceeded to enchant Hoosiers with a variety of incredible tastes and smells that tempted young and old alike.""We stumbled upon this restaurant, thinking it was the former tenant having a re-opening event.  While they have borrowed on some of the wonderful things that were found in the building's previous incarnation, La Eskina has fully taken over and claimed this corner.  The interior is bright and charming with colorful décor with a kitschy vibe.   We were greeted warmly and welcomed as if we were long, lost friends.The food is a wonderful mix of old and new Mexican flavors.  We started off with two appetizers: the guacamole with carnitas and the esquites, a version of Mexican street corn that is served off the cob.  Wow, both items were packed with flavor.  The guacamole came with hand made chips that were a treat themselves.  Both appetizers were generous in size and would have easily served four people.While we were finishing up our appetizers they brought the main dinners.  We had the traditional carnitas and the enchiladas potosinas.  The carnitas were tender and flavorful.  They came with rice, beans and tortillas, standard fare.  What wasn't standard was how much flavor each item on the plate had.  The beans and rice were both bursting with flavor.  The enchiladas were a chicken and cheese enchilada with the enchilada covered in a chili-infused masa.  Once again, bite after flavor-filled bite.We were stuffed but couldn't pass up the gorgeous cakes in their display case.  We were told these were from a Mexican bakery west of town.   A piece of tres leches with oreos and a piece of rompope cake (think eggnog tres leches) found their way into the bag with our leftovers to be enjoyed later.  And enjoyed they were.This place is has wonderful food, service and atmosphere.  It was a fabulous evening and a fabulous meal.  We will definitely be going back.  There are too many delicious things on the menu to try not to hurry back soon.",3BoVJJRVBgfqKIbPI3IdzA,2022-01-18 19:22:59,kWbCmkx7Pd1kzHDT919FLA,5,Rebecca
kSdf5eG-SqO3rMiEKms3ag,"Finally! A place with authentic Mexican and street eats! They just opened and overall, a great experience and great quality food.Food: 4.5/5 We started off trying the queso and guacamole, and both were absolutely superb. The Queso was velvety and completely different from most quesos since it had some spice. The guacamole was perfectly seasoned and had a nice milk heat from the jalapeño too.Their salsas are homemade and damn so good! Finally, someone in downtown that made real salsa, not the tomato puree that most places serve. So HUGE SHOUT OUT for this.We split 2 huitlacoche (corn fungus) tacos - don't knock it until you try it. I am Mexican and LOVE huitlacoche and you rarely ever see it on menus so MAJOR props to the folks at La Eskina. I taste just like a mushroom with a little flavor of corn that is velvety and a little smoky/earthy. I hope you never take it off the menu.Now onto entrees (yes we were crazy hungry and didn't eat lunch).My wife got enchiladas and THANK GOD, finally actual enchiladas that are not smothered in cheese and sour cream. She said they were super tasty, had a good balance, and the chicken wasn't dry.I got the carnitas - this in my opinion missed the mark. The carnitas was lackluster in flavor and not sure if they were quickly simmered in the sauce and threw it on the plate, but it was not my favorite. The portion was compared to the rest of the plate which was a bummer. Maybe it was an off night or supply chain issue but I would be willing to try again. The arroz and frijoles were absolutely fantastic which did make up for a lot. I would be willing to try their other items on the menu when we come back.Service: 4/5The folks were all super nice and I know staffing is super hard especially now with the labor shortages, supply chain issues, etc that have totally wreaked havoc on the restaurant industry. The reason a point is lost here is that we ordered some esquites that never came and had to ask for normal service-related things like napkins and silverware multiple times. Once we asked for the stuff, they did help right away which was great. They just opened recently, so I will definitely cut them some slack and wouldn't change my mind about going back again based on this one experience. Our waitress was still super nice and what looked like the manager/owner did come by a few times too. Overall, nothing I would say ruined our dinner by any means, just some kinks to work out.Vibe: 5/5 I was fearful that the inside would be made to look like a discoteca and be kitschy but honestly, I am so happy they kept some of the original charms of Tortas. I really enjoyed that they paid homage to the previous restaurant owners by keeping celebrity-inspired Tortas on the menu and keeping the exposed brick.I only knock some points based on my experience with the Carnitas and some of the Service issues. Definitely check this place out and we will definitely be back for more!!",dBVcHfFKTJDH7Die6Frz2w,2022-01-13 23:55:35,kWbCmkx7Pd1kzHDT919FLA,5,Ricky
