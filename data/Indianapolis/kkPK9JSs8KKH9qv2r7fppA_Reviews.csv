wFPh5pkegOa3kKuw5pMcEw,"I enjoyed our time at Brew Link immensely. It reminds me a lot of two deep, but with better food. I think the atmosphere is something they could work on just coming from the other location a few weeks ago. Their outdoor space and ability to host larger crowds will be a big advantage for them soon I think. We had the avocado fries and the asian brisket tips for appetizers. Both delicious! The asian brisket tips are probably what I will get for my meal the next time. They were that good.I had the Beast burger. It was a little bit of a letdown really. It's their most expensive burger and has a very tasty sounding blend of wagyu beef, elk, boar, and bison. I added pepper jack cheese. It was just eh. Not a ton of flavor. It was not bad, just not great, as the price would make it seem like it should be. The fries that came with it were really good. The other people in our group got the chicken quesadilla (very tasty), the beer mac (very good), and the Texas BBQ brisket sandwich. Honestly, that brisket sandwich is one of the best sandwiches I have ever had! The flavor was full and savory. It wasn't too salty. It wasn't too heavy. It had the perfect blend of spices, meat, cheese, and bread that created a delectable bite! I know I mentioned the brisket tips earlier, but this is thing I am getting next time. I know I didn't mention much about the beer, which is odd since this is a brewery, but in this case it is not a bad thing. We tried several different beers and each one was as good as the one before. I did not have anything that I did not like in their beer lineup.We came about a half hour before closing on a Thursday, the staff was friendly, and the food was quick and hot, and they didn't pressure us out while they were closing up. Just started cleaning and let us finish our drinks. I would highly recommend this place for your dining and drinking pleasure.They also had a bunch of TVs!",1yuV6loIL1aWgOsJJicQWg,2021-04-13 17:46:57,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Sean
oekUXdAJB6icJy55RMJV5w,"My girlfriend and I were there on Friday 4/16/2021. When we entered we were greeted by a very friendly server. She greeted us and ask the server if she could clean the table. The waitress acted like it was not high on her list. My girlfriend ask if we could be sat in a different section. We were sat and waited on by a nice waiter. He was very pleasant and informative. It was our first time at this location. They were out of several beers. Understandable they are still working out the kinks. We ordered food and drinks. The mixed drinks were great. Before we left my girlfriend wanted to go to the ladies room. As she was walking to the women's room the first waitress hollered down the hallway ""Sir the men's bathroom is here.""  My girlfriend had on a sweatshirt and a baseball cap. The waitress took it upon herself to assume that she was a man. She came back to the table fully embarrassed and upset. She left and I spoke to the manager. The manager was very nice and apologetic. After the conversation I offered to pay three times and she stated no the dinner was on her. I did not expect this. I just wanted to let her know that the waitress needed diversity training. We will not be back.",isGZNN2bead0PlLHzLt-MA,2021-04-20 22:14:50,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,3,Fawn

4xk8MZ0BMv-SZ7MbEIndMQ,"We really have enjoyed Brew Link in Plainfield and we were excited to try the downtown location. It was easy to get to and park coming in from the West side. The interior was for the most part as expected from the photos and lots of space for those wanting to keep some social distancing. Our stop on a late Saturday afternoon had an older city vibe as expected versus Plainfield, almost like a city diner. Our food and drinks were good and about the same as the Plainfield location, but I felt the tacos and chips were a little better in Plainfield. With the Plainfield location being 10 minutes closer I think we will stick with it for getting our Brew Link  fix - but if you are closer to the city it's still definitely worth the visit.The biggest advantage this location has is the space and ability for patrons to distance with mini bar- table stations,  the large main bar,  and dozens of spread out tables.",cJg5C9tslHaCj591OzY5bQ,2021-05-09 11:35:48,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Ron
ot6RZzITxryqQUFJqP1FvA,"Great location and parking are a plus here! I  came with a friend before the NCAA Championship game. We decided to sit on the patio which is dog friendly. Our waitress, unfortunately, was no great and took about 30 minutes to bring us water after many promises it would be coming. There's a full cocktail menu if you are not a beer fan. I had the Hoosier Shake Up which is basically your standard Indy State Fair Lemonade Shake Up with a shot of vodka. Incredibly sweet! My friend ordered a cider and seemed to enjoy it. For dinner, we shared a plate of pickle fries which were too battered seemed more like fried batter than fried pickles. I had a pulled pork burger which was good, but need more barbecue sauce. To my surprise, I was charhed for this sauce! My friend had the Buffalo chicken sandwich and said it was good, but could have been better. All in all, standard bar fare, but there's definitely better options downtown.",hqcqfT_h59tU6mcLW2XnaA,2021-04-06 18:02:55,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,3,Aerionna
fZoJkiYZsKYMEspPCPTSrw,"I don't just give out  FIVE   star reviews!  Brew Link Brewing really knocked it out of the park for us! The food was amazing, they have a full bar AND though I'm not a beer drinker, they did have VERY delicious brews! Our server/bartender was awesome. He greeted us right away and took great care of us. I was so excited for the Mac and cheese MENU  I mean, come on, a whole section of Mac n cheese?! I got the Brewpub Brisket Chili Mac; I asked them to add mushrooms and leave off the sour cream. The Man got the BBQ pulled pork burger and a side of Mac n cheese. We also got some flights of beer.  The flavor in everything (beer included) was perfect and exactly what you'd want.

YU6LFLuntez6Pq6obdFCYA,Was real happy with our quick stop here. My husband and I both enjoyed our beers...Lucid and Lil Lucid. The dry rub smoked wings were bomb. Don't miss out on the Carolina BBQ sauce! Fries and ranch dressing were also great. Solid brew pub with some good food and a lot on the menu! Lots of space for bigger groups too!

Vh9Rde067jRwpGMikBW7wg,My friend and I decided to try Brew Link because of the great reviews. We're really all about trying places that have great wings. I can't say that I loved the wings but they weren't terrible. They were lacking some flavor and maybe it's because they're smoked. But I'm not sure. I got half Buffalo & half garlic Parmesan (which I hated) but they exchanged for the sweet Asian ginger. Those were much better. All in all great service! And if we do go back I'll try something different,-dt3mWLL66eD_2i9RHD0qw,2021-08-03 20:20:51,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Vashti
GEMKU06yIHXgCdrEoSVauA,Lucid IPA is light but hoppy. It's FIRE if you like IPAs. I also had the dry rub wings with the Alabama sauce and the burger with Mac n cheese. Tater tots were fried to perfection.... I also got to bring my dog and sit on the patio. Decent number of spots in the parking lot for it to be downtown! Customer recommendations: If you get coleslaw put that Alabama sauce in your coleslaw... if you're one of the those people who dislike coleslaw this is not for you!!

mwESR8MZyg2e_9bVkOpzfA,"Solid 5/5 stars. Great service each time I have come. Love that this brewery also offers cocktails, wine, and liquor, which is sometimes rare for a local craft brewery. The food is top notch. This gives me Sahm's vibes, which I give as a great compliment. I would highly recommend brew link for a place to watch sports, grab dinner, have brunch, or a casual drink. The Lucid IPA is amazing and many vegetarian options set this at the top of my list.",3D9HcJ8emxyoS9qCUl1mHA,2021-12-13 23:28:48,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,5,Liz

5KMz_fHvmuDAn0xaVnkHpw,"Brew Link Brewing is a wonderful Brewery/restaurant that recently opened up in downtown Indy that has a good selection of food and craft beer.   The nutter butter beer is my personal favorite because it tastes just like a Reese's Peanut butter cup.   The hazy IPA is excellent and the ivory beer is good as well.   I ordered the grilled chicken salad and a side of fruit.  It was delicious and fresh.  The Avocado fries were very unique and tasted wonderful.   I will say the service could have been better. I waited a long time to get my beer order in, and the restaurant was not that busy.  One of the servers had a little attitude l could tell, but he didn't take it out on our group.  He was flustered from work.  We still enjoyed our meal and the beer,  so everyone was happy! The restaurant is nice and has a beautiful ambiance inside and outside as well.  The outdoor patio is nice as well.  All in all, Brew Link Brewing is a wonderful place for beer and food.   I would come back here again to unwind with friends.",goCRfCCpjP7ndyxuOu4WPQ,2021-06-17 03:18:58,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Michael

Everything on their menu is very tasty. The service is pretty quick and friendly, We really like to sit at the bar. They have seating outside, free parking, and the bill won't break the bank. My husband and I usually get 2 flights to share, two meals, and sometimes an appetizer. We don't usually spend no more than $70 including tip.",hR-OTr2aWhG-FUfL8z0yqg,2021-05-15 18:58:40,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,5,Hailey

VO_ZYcyWUT9wt4XvQTwe2w,"It my opinion, the beer is slightly above average, but it did not blow me away.  That being said the Ivory Stout and Nuttercup are definitely good beers, but the IPAs were so-so.  That being said the two appetizers were awesome.  We got the traditional dry rub wings with Alabama white BBQ and the avocado fries with jalapeño ranch and those might have been two of the best appetizers I have ever had.

Their in-house, craft brew list is interesting and the IPA I tried was sooo good.  I tried Avocado fries, pickle fries and smoked, dry rub chicken wings.

The salad was a hefty portion size and the salmon flaked right off. The fries were crunchy and amazing! I will need to come back here to try some more food. Their most popular food items seem to be their nachos, burgers and fries.They have great local, hand-crafted beers that pair well with the food items on their menu. There is a type of beer for anyone who decides to come here; from hazy to hoppy to IPAs, their choices are diverse.

They also have a full bar for mixed drinks. Menu is good solid bar food. Mix of salads, wraps, sandwiches etc. I do wish they had more sided to choose from instead of just fried foods like tots or fruit. Rice or salad etc would be nice to choose from to break up the heavy meals . Their brunch is also delicious and highly recommended for good food and mimosa pitchers. I had the blackened salmon Caesar salad for lunch one day which came with all kind of goodies on the salad and was very large and filling.

I feel like I should be talking about the beer since this place is a brewery, but my mouth is just still watering typing this. The beer is just an added perk. There's a pretty large parking lot which I feel like is really nice downtown. It's kinda in an odd spot so I feel like they deserve your business since it won't get as much hype as some of the centrally located downtown businesses.

Had the beast burger (waygu beef, wild boar, elk, bison) which was nice and juicy. Honestly not sure if my palate could tell the difference but it was tasty. The tater tots were beautifully fried and delicious and GENEROUSLY portioned! Had the stone cold hazy ipa, very nice not overly fruity. Enjoyed the outdoor seating of about a dozen tables.

DbdwrvgL7fqyHJg_ICvFBg,"If I could give another half star, I would.  They almost get 5 stars because you can grab good food and some beer on a Monday when a lot of places are closed.  After a doctor's appt which ran more than an hour late, it was nearly 3 by the time we got here for lunch.  Brewlink was open in the spot that was formerly TwoDeep Brewing.  Still looks similar and has the convenient parking on the north side of the building, with easy southbound access on Capitol Ave.I decided to go with a flight of 4 (most are $2 per small glass).  Each of the brews I have had at their other locations have been good, so I didn't even ask for tastes, but just made my decision off the tap list menu description.  I was quite pleased with all four choices.And they had a nice lunch menu to select from.  My wife got a Beer Mac n Cheese with Chicken that had a good flavor (but the chicken was a little dry if not dipped in the creamy sauce.)  I ordered the Beast Burger which has Bison, Elk, and Wagyu beef which kept it from being dry.  The fries on the side were really good too.  So a solid 4+ on the food.  My wife has some mobility trouble and even though there were just a few steps down, they don't have a central handrail for stability which would be a great addition. (they do have one along the wall though.) I didn't ask about ramps though, so I don't know what their plan is for people who have even more mobility issues than we did.  Overall, we really liked the place and would recommend it if you want to avoid the crowds of downtown and near the convention center but not be too far away if you were going to do something later.Looks like they may have some outdoor seating in warmer weather too.Give them a try if you don't feel like driving all the way to Plainfield to try their beer.Review #3892",wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,2021-03-22 21:58:05,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Ken

I had a tenderloin sandwich and tots. I can never eat everything in one sitting so naturally had leftovers. The tots were great. The tenderloin was OK. A little hard to chew.

zOf347lbTVO-p4oC-gE5mg,I hadn't been to this location in over 2 years.   Back then it was a different brewery (I don't remember the name).   Apparently they called it quite and then someone else came in and Brewlink was born.    They make a wide variety of beers.   Most interesting is the number of sours they carry.     The blueberry donut sour ale is very good.The food menu also looked pretty good to me so I'll have to drop in for lunch some day. Bonus:   all growler fills are only $10 on Sundays (usually $12-16).,2iS1vg5TYpV_iEiNC8osTg,2021-07-16 17:37:14,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Peter
y0Revp2zhr-M9lxriUI87w,"I've been here a few times since they opened, and I like this addition to an area of town that attracts a lot of foot traffic with the canal, cultural trail, and playground/greenspace, but doesn't have a lot of options for food.They made the large, open interior seem a little more modern, but the addition of the seemingly permanent outdoor area is the most significant change to the space since the TwoDeep days. It isn't the largest outdoor area in the city, nor is it the most scenic with its location in a parking lot and adjacent to Capitol Ave traffic, but it is a welcome addition to the location. It still has a great indoor area that is very open and would be a great place to host an event. They have a parking lot for cars, and there is bike parking for anyone out enjoying the many paths around the area.Brew Link already gained a good reputation for their beer and food from their original location in Plainfield, and they carried that over here. The beer menu has something for everybody, although it doesn't seem like they get as much of the cool stuff that the Plainfield location sometimes has on tap. However, this location adds a 3-way license so you can also get cocktails and wine. The food menu is also expanded quite a bit at this location, and borders on the line of trying to do too much. The menu includes a wide variety of sandwiches, paninis, and burgers as well as a massive appetizer menu, unique mac and cheese combinations, tacos, and large salads. I have only had a couple things here, but they have been good for the price.This place is worth the trip for some good beers and a bite to eat if you are looking for a casual setting and crowd-pleasing options.",kCBMksMPqNPw2dfWH_deXQ,2021-07-13 13:34:26,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Dylan

For dinner I got the avocado chicken wrap that included a cumin ranch sauce, which was a great addition. If I could choose one thing to change it would be shredded pepperjack cheese instead of thick pieces in the wrap. The Mac & Cheese side was creamy, the flavor mimicked beer cheese which I was here for.

Can't wait to also check out the Plainfield location.",MHHczaCKqU9JyITYuZRvIw,2021-12-18 13:06:02,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,5,Hannah
FUlxvdErc7cZJGhNFxcaJQ,This was our first visit to this location. We used to go to the original Plainfield location and we visit them at the golf course now.  It was easy to get to from the south side and the parking was plentiful.  The brunch was good. I had the brisket and poblano hash.  The brisket was seasoned nicely.  It took a little while for our second round of drinks and we had a little spill early so it took a bit to get more silverware.  The beers are can't and the blueberry hole in one is the best.,YB94yfRxIHL2-x6ag725PA,2021-05-16 17:33:57,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Dan

9mjEpwULsO0j3cLIQbUbCA,"The first positive was free downtown parking right off of Capital close to the entrance. Easy to find and two interior entrances with one on Capital and one from the parking lot. The hostess stand is by the parking lot entrance. Brew Links impressed us as they've only been open 7 weeks but they were running like a well oiled machine.We've been wanting to try the new Brew Link on Capital after becoming a fan of the original location in downtown Plainfield a couple of years ago. We've always got a kick out of the fun beer names like Nuttercup and Now Now Brown Cow and enjoyed the creative beers they brew.This location is open and airy with a large bar and 4-top and 8-top tables plus patio seating.  A nice corner fireplace, several flat screens and tonight we found out it was Triva Night at 7:00p.Brew Links offers Signature Cocktails, Bourbon & Whiskey, Wines and of course their beers. Now Now Brown Cow,  Stone Cold Hazy with tangerine, Nuttercup is a chocolate and peanut butter porter (a liquid reese's cup) and Alien Hot Tub with grapefruit to name a few of the taps.Food wise they offer Appetizers, Paninis and Handheld Sandwiches, Mac and Cheese Entrees, Salads, Soup, Tacos, Burgers and great sides.We started with the Smoked Dry Rub Traditional Wings which were excellent. The skin was lightly crispy and the rub was delicious. Highly recommend if you're a wing lover.For dinner, my husband ordered the Beast Burger with Waygu beef, wild boar, elk and bison with tarter tots. He loved the Burger and the tots were cooked perfectly and so good. He will order both again.I had the Black n' Blu Burger with Mac and Cheese. The burger was cooked a tad more than I like but it was still juicy and smothered in blue cheese. The Mac and Cheese was good but not the highlight of my meal.We were impressed with our server and he was fantastic. We never felt rushed, he answered several questions and knew the menu well.We both agreed we loved everything and can't wait to return to try other items on the menu.",zYFGMy1_thjMnvQLX6JNBw,2021-05-06 06:32:27,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,5,Wanda
qHp9O0NxMTMbTif4FOXI9w,"Brew Link on Capitol is the 3rd stop in Indy by the Indy Wing Club.  We try to sample a variety of wings at each location while balancing what we think sounds the best vs what the staff recommends.  Therefore we all thought the traditional dry rub with Alabama White Sauce sounded great, so we ordered those.  Then we took the recommendations of our waitress by going with Mango Habanero and Asian Ginger.  The wing sizes come in 1 lb orders which equates to roughly 7-8 wings.  The wings are smoked then fried and have great flavor, they are also falling off the bone while you are enjoying.  The skin could be slightly crispier, but it was not a major turnoff while eating.  Explaining each wing experience:- Traditional dry rub has a good amount of dry rub covering the wings and unlike other dry rubs we have experienced these did NOT need a sauce to combat the dryness.  The were juicy and flavorful in their own merit but the white BBQ was a great pairing.- Asian Ginger was a good amount of flavor and tasted different enough from a traditional teriyaki bath that most restaurants do to save time and effort.  They are a little sweet and the sauce is thicker, and the ginger spice could be a bit stronger, but overall the have a good flavor.  While not as enjoyable as the dry rub, they are worth a try.- Mango Habanero is a sauce that the waitress said was her favorite.  When you hear Habanero you think spicy, but there is no spice with these in my opinion.  They could use an additional kick to balance the sweetness of the mango sauce.  They were fine, but they didn't have a flavor pop that really stood out, so they were the flavor we would not order again of the 3.Ultimately after tasting all three we all enjoyed the traditional dry rub with Alabama white the most with Asian ginger being our second favorite and mango habanero being our third favorite.While this is primarily a beer place the wings and the avocado fries are worth a try for those who love bar food.  Stay tuned for the Indy Wing Clubs future wing reviews and Happy Yelping!",FnNmbt953nh7H3Hv6zo42w,2021-05-21 10:19:55,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Evan
RJ35ymiomXUh9wCzJpyNvA,"Love the Milkshake IPA's that brew link has made in the past.  They are super yummy on a hot day and the can art work is fun too!  Today, being winter, I tried the darker beers and the peanut butter stout is delicious!  I happened to be in here on Taco Tuesday and thoroughly enjoyed the $2 taco, flavorful.  This location downtown is perfect in that it's right off the cultural trail and minutes from the canal.  Inside space is big, plenty of room to spread out.",KhHwhL89YnbEw8RNM03C4A,2021-12-17 11:35:16,kkPK9JSs8KKH9qv2r7fppA,4,Mark
