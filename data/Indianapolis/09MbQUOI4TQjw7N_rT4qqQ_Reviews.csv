QNMZPftjmZZnfCdukvtMVw,"Solid poke! I ordered the standard sized bowl for myself and it was very filling for the price. The menu was displayed and easy to follow. My two proteins were the spicy crab and marinated tuna, and both had great flavors. I think the sauces are the best part of poke bowls and they had quite the unique variety to offer. I tried the unagi sauce and the Sichuan Mayo and I really liked the combo. They were quite generous with the sauces as well. Toppings wise, I wish there were more to choose from. Customer service was pretty good. Overall, an enjoyable meal!",QNbRNTd7d1JBj5oQPSYHXQ,2021-08-05 05:17:16,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Emma
DORsI28_g4LV9asuV7CmFw,"After the Yelp tasting I stopped by AMP to try Andre's since I missed it during the event.  It was around 4 pm so only a few restaurants were open...I discovered most are only open for lunch during the week.  After leaving Andre's BBQ,  I noticed Poke Guru tucked in the corner! I remembered the great bowl I received as a sample and grabbed the same bowl for lunch and saved Andre's for dinner. I wasn't sure what toppings and sauce I had the previous week but the employee was very helpful in helping me recreate the perfect bowl.  The brown rice, BBQ shrimp, corn, carrots, and red onions topped with the perfect dressing has quickly become my favorite.  If you visit AMP please sure to visit Poke situated off the path.",S2vKiuKvw7K8qF3Tar0sfA,2021-07-10 07:22:56,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Gelone
ss7IQPBtME3N9kZHGraEFg,"Wow -- so good. Now, I didn't get the poke, despite my unwritten rule of always ordering the thing that's in the restaurant's name if I'm visiting for the first time. But I'm happy to tell you that even if you don't order the poke, and you order, say, the Korean bbq shrimp, you will have a happy experience like I did. Assuming you like Korean bbq shrimp.Anyway, my bowl consisted of sushi rice, Korean bbq shrimp, edamame, pickled daikon, pineapple, wasabi peas, seaweed, and marinated onion, plus a spicy mayo sauce. Holy hell, dude. The contrast of spicy with sweet and salty and umami was amazing. My bowl was perfect. I think part of the reason why my bowl tasted so good is because I kind of let the person behind the counter recommend what I should put on it. He seemed to know more about the product than I did, and he seemed super enthusiastic about particular foods, so I just submitted and let him make my bowl. I would say to any of you who might not know exactly what you want to try asking the people who work there what they suggest! They might just suggest a magical combination.",OIDpKC2p61qVO_spPqw1qA,2021-08-07 00:00:06,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Nicole
4YVyvp6NJ4lzVq6fPdh7gQ,"I built my own bowl and it was all of my favorite things - ahi tuna, salmon, wasabi peas, cucumber, avocado, pickled ginger, spicy Mayo...(They were temp out of edamame and pickled dikon so it'll be a fun different combination next time.). Bowl was a nice serving - light but filling.",iFNfmvYpbWmlOFCmzIBgQw,2021-07-06 20:22:37,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Erin
nJeRSzcyAdILdzB-LPGZnA,"This is my favorite Poke spot, since I am very picky about my poke. Here you get to personalize your bowls, so it's up to your creativity. Instructions are on a poster also to guide you through the process. You want to first select your size. While I am always tempted to get the large, the 'small' is in no way small and I can barely finish that as is. And let it be said that I can put away quite a bit of food. I tend to go with the sushi rice, but have had the pleasure of half sushi rice and half greens which was very nice also. My favorite proteins are the spicy crab and the BBQ shrimp. Yep, I am squeemish when it comes to raw fish, so this is a great alternative for me. Then for the toppings, well they are too numerous to list here. I highly recommend the mustard seeds, the marinated red onion and the pickled daikon. but since everything is so fresh and delicious, you just can't go wrong. As a finishing touch, add some sauces/dips to your bowl or have some on the side. I am hooked on the spicy mayo.Bon appetit",7RlmJFtraL6HqNMlHvnmsA,2021-08-26 15:35:20,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Sigrid
i-rIRKBZF-vjbwaQRQmP0Q,"I just moved back to Indy after nearly ten years away. The restaurant scene is so much better than before. But I was really surprised to find many poke restaurants. Poke Guru caught my eye, especially because they offered delivery via door dash.  while searching for a vegetarian or pescatarian meal while at work yesterday. It is really hard to find pescatarian meals and I am dairy free too. It is sometimes extremely challenging to find delicious, fresh and healthy meals that I can eat.   This place is fantastic! I ordered the The Original with rice, salmon and fried tofu with the delicious sesame & soy marinade seaweed, edamame, cucumber, avocado. It was fantastic and absolutely delicious. I will absolutely order from Poke Guru again. I wish it was not so expensive to get  delivered. But I will defiantly order or pick up this fantastic meal again!",NG1fVAx6mj5iXT-NBDTz6w,2021-07-02 13:31:31,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Kate
IX74-vZYNsL2qcZ_NuSdfQ,"I recently discovered this place at a Yelp event to sample AMP vendors. Tuna poke is one of my favorite food so I was excited to score a free bowl. I saved it for the next day for lunch at was thrilled at how fresh and delicious every ingredient was.I came back a few days later while eating at another vendor. Since I don't live close, I decided to get a bowl for the next day. I love how bright red the raw tuna is, you can tell how fresh it is just by looking. There are so many ingredients to choose from, including sauces to marinate the tuna and sauces for topping.I built my bowl with sushi rice, ahi tuna, spicy crab meat, avocado, carrots, wasabi peas (great crunch!), and jalapeños. I got the soy sauce tuna marinade and topped the bowl with spicy Mayo. I got a side of unagi sauce as well. $10 is not a bad price, especially since raw fish of this quality is difficult to find in Indiana.This is definitely a new staple in my restaurant rotation. Give them a try!",xX140fHVpOOzc1pN4gsjng,2021-06-24 20:32:55,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Meg
8Cy7Bx0-6K-jpO9Ft-n40w,"I used to live on Poke when I lived out west so I was thrilled to find Poke Guru at the new AMP 16. It's located right inside the main entrance so hard to miss. The woman behind the counter was very helpful and offered tastes of ingredients to those who wanted to try something new. I'd never had pickled mustard seeds before and they are a great addition to a poke bowl. In regards to the Poke you can order a signature bowl or build your own and they come in 2 sizes. I like to build my own and there are plenty of options. You can chose from 3 proteins, ahi tuna, salmon, or tofu and the base options are brown rice, sushi rice or mixed greens. Veggies options were plentiful as well and I love when seaweed salad is available and it was very good here. There are also several different sauces to chose from. All items are very fresh!  The only thing a bit disappointing is that they don't have liquor at this location. No fault of Poke as it seems to be an AMP requirement as there is a full bar in the food court. So there are drink options available. Poke is very affordable and I received a 30% coupon this morning so I will be back soon. AMP 16 is a fun location so get out and get some Poke!",ZLBWZaDQ0yYkNK9dfDYwpg,2021-07-15 14:15:37,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Laura
-g_4-AoM2dNLP7uEGEfV7g,Poke Guru is consistently amazing. Love being able to build my own bowl. Perfect size for lunch. Lots of healthy options. Definitely check it out.,u-7Y4SqNJ1yTaoZYjUXLrQ,2021-12-31 21:13:15,09MbQUOI4TQjw7N_rT4qqQ,5,Meg
