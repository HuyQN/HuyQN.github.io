2GwRka2is6jHyB1rlr9xHw,"Shake Shack's new location has finally opened up in Downtown Indianapolis! It is situated at the beginning of Mass Ave which is a great location for downtown workers/visitors.The menu has burgers, chicken sandwiches, hot dogs, and shakes. The single patty is pretty small, the group I was with mostly got two burgers/sandwiches due to this but I'm sure the double will also be filling. I personally found the single to be just right with an order or fries. The burger was simple and tasty, and fries were spot on.They do have lemonade drinks, but not sure if these are for me. I had the Cran Citrus Punch and was indifferent. I'll be back to try a shake :).My group all individually ordered via the app for pickup when we left our office, and after walking there our order was ready. This was fast and easy through the app!",hinrYC95HxT8V2wupp0LvA,2021-12-18 17:30:30,qvGoBKNSoW6PW1eE0C3t6A,4,Brittany
ZmmoiNzvnsln2_-MEFPD-Q,"The new ShakeShack opened downtown Indianapolis It's a great place to get good-quality burgers and chicken sandwiches, their menu is small but everything is great! Definitely good quality We got the SmokeShack which comes with bacon and cheese and it was around $7, definitely not very cheapWe also got fries and purple cows, which is grapefruit soda with vanilla ice creamFor dessert we shared a black and white shake, worth the $6!",ZxjOitafHu6o5crXllN8pQ,2021-12-18 00:47:11,qvGoBKNSoW6PW1eE0C3t6A,5,Patricia Abigail
sJzEgpd0vGmvZ7wErh1osg,"Anxiously we have waited for the arrival of Shake Shack to the Indy dining scene.  I finally got the opportunity to go this week and try out the place that everyone is talking about.The menu is burgers, chicken, hotdogs and shakes.  They have several different options for each and you are able to order at either a kiosk or at a live person at a register.  I opted for the kiosk and it was surprisingly intuitive.  I ordered a single patty Shack Burger and an order of crinkle fries.  The burger patty was the smashburger variety and was well done with thin, crispy edges.  The fries were lightly golden and well seasoned.  Both items were good and a good value for the money.  Next time I go, I will definitely get a double burger.  While the hamburger was good, the bun definitely dwarfed the single patty.  I also will try a shake as all the ones I saw around me looked pretty darn good.",3BoVJJRVBgfqKIbPI3IdzA,2022-01-17 21:58:54,qvGoBKNSoW6PW1eE0C3t6A,4,Rebecca
X3rVUi6naGl_g77RBzhfBQ,"Finally another burger option downtown. I have been anxiously awaiting for this to open!On the fly we decided to stop in on a random Thursday. They just opened perhaps the week prior. I was VERY fortunate and found a spot right in front. If I hadn't, parking may be a bit of an issue especially with the construction happening on all around it. Perhaps parking on Mass Ave and walking over could be a solution if no parking on the street in front.When we walked in it is VERY bright and cheerful. They have music playing but I can't recall what type. We ordered via a kiosk so we didn't actually speak with anyone. I do like having the option to order myself as opposed to explaining my order to someone else. I'm hoping more places go this route. One thing that really shocked me is it didn't seem very clean. It seemed like a college town place. Perhaps its because I'm used to the other places in the area being very well kept up, I guess I expected something a little different. We ordered chicken tenders, fries, burger and a shake. It was good okay, the sauce for my tenders was great. The tenders itself were just okay. I don't think they were cooked long enough. The fries were very good and the burger was just okay.I do plan go go back because maybe they are still getting things in order since it just opened.",67AUkTi7QxQBnNFeZQ16Nw,2021-12-30 00:35:02,qvGoBKNSoW6PW1eE0C3t6A,3,Sheree
GGp-gYyfhIyLdb4uhO60sA,"I'm going to be super honest. I read mixed reviews and I have very low expectations going in. Crinkle fries are not my thing. When I think of them I think of a soggy mess. But...Shake Shack blew it out of the water!My sister recommended the SmokeShack burger and it was so incredibly flavorful, in all the best ways! Salty, sweet, spicy. Yum! The burger has bacon, cherry peppers and a delicious sauce. The bun was so soft I wanted to just lay in it! Now let's get to those crinkle fries. I got my order to go so I had them put some cheese sauce on the side. I still expected my fries to be somewhat soggy when I got home, but all I found were crispy and delicious fries in my box! How do they do it? I noticed the box had some good cut outs to vent the fries so they didn't steam. That must be it. Other fast food restaurants should take note.Pick-up was easy and the service was very friendly.Any restaurant that can get a crinkle fry right has my business!",fiGSeA6Cew0IfPy0w2IZMg,2022-01-01 23:38:25,qvGoBKNSoW6PW1eE0C3t6A,5,Bridget
