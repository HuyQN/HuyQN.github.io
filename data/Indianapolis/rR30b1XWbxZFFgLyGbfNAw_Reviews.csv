UskXG34CHHskXqF6mYaMXw,"I was really excited to try BODHI because there was so much hype! The ambience is perfect for date night and the food was tasty. We started with cocktails and crab puffs. The drinks were pretty strong, but good. I had the chili and basil stir-fry and my boyfriend had the roasted chili shrimp stir-fry. Both were good, but I'm excited to get the curry the next time that I go. A few cons though: we waited over an hour and there was no resevration. The stir-fry was good but not exceptional.",G4INXI5tPZcZo5HbB8sLCw,2021-07-24 00:29:41,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Sarah

M0xw71zhvv8dA-01lY6n9g,"Atmosphere, food and staff were all amazing! The crab puffs put Crab Rangoon I have ever had to shame. Drunken noodles were so tasty as well, and you can adjust the spice level. I would recommend mild for drunken noodles if you don't like spicy food. They also have a super cute patio and some of it is covered from the sun.",09-H4lUu4Bq5pIKmF_oBlw,2021-07-31 18:07:38,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Lacy

YvfKvqcFrG6ylCCwqhKUcw,"Always very pleased to see an independently owned restaurant on mass Ave. this review I write with mixed feelings.  Good set up. Pretty with well spaced tables.  I indeed had a friendly, efficient, knowledgeable wait person. I observed the rest of staff being frenetic, rolling eyes. Unprofessional management. I heard them complaining about the amount of take out orders.  I should not have had to listen to this ungrateful ranting. Food was delicious however not a user friendly menu.  It made ordering very difficult. Normally at a Thai restaurant it is easy to order. This one made no sense.  It was  very expensive for the portion size. Rather weird in fact. And when wanting perhaps a half size of soup for example to accompany a main dish I was told there were take out boxes for the leftovers. Too much attitude for me.  This  delicious food has usually a moderate fair price. I found it way too much money for the value.   And I guess everyone is confused. For the price people should have been dressed not in picnic wear or after the gym. Men wearing baseball caps.  I found it confusing to say the least.",1-ArVIhEJ_4hryWIESnPdg,2021-07-09 03:42:02,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,3,Ellen

KukDxOBBwm4dvZjpJndiBg,"The first of its kind in Indianapolis! The drinks were expensive but AMAZING and all of the food was spectacular. The outdoor patio is to die for as well as the tasteful and modern decor inside :) would definitely recommend getting ""medium"" spice as it's not too spicy.Be sure to find street parking and come hungry.

I love the atmosphere and the vibe here, they have food for vegetarian and meatarians so grab everyone and head to Bodhi!",ZxjOitafHu6o5crXllN8pQ,2021-07-18 15:42:36,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Patricia Abigail
bO2oxCkKkHLgpyefKjUSxg,"This place is absolutely outstanding! There's nowhere else like it in Indianapolis. My partner and I recently moved from the NYC area, and until Bodhi came along, we've been having a hard time finding truly notable East Asian restaurants. Not only does Bodhi meet the mark, it surpassed our expectations! We ordered their steak salad which was nothing less than top-of-the-line art cuisine with a memorable taste that I still crave, their ""Curry Spaghetti"" which I never knew existed but I discovered I've always wanted (this place is the only place I've had anything like this, and I am in love), and we also ordered their Penang Curry which has quickly become our favorite Penang Curry from *any* restaurant we've been to (and we have been to many ...).If you want real Thai food, where each bite takes at least 2 minutes to fully savor, this place is it. Really. I love it. I'm so glad they opened up!! (And, I'm stoked for the drinks ... that menu looks KILLERRRRRR).",VXsIEzOCdND6DQUXflfUsw,2021-03-25 02:05:29,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Leon
n6N-8hRwpt31NwIbGG-Wcg,"Located at the end of Mass Ave, Bodhi is the new, trendy Thai spot in town. The interior is beautifully decorated with a garden wall and has a lively atmosphere (reminds me of nyc!) There is very limited indoor and outdoor seating and they don't take reservations. The wait can be up to 2 hours on the weekends so I recommend putting your name down and walking around the Bottleworks District. Bodhi had fun craft cocktails and the food was great. The spring rolls and drunken noodles were my favorite. If you do have a low spice tolerance, I recommend sticking with mild since medium had a delicious but definitely a good kick to it.",DWs3moceKvfeAwcenO_9rg,2021-03-27 03:04:27,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Natalie
fZA7NS7pz0Wx6s_8XRkI3A,"Great food and cocktails.  Went for an early dinner and there was already a wait, but the people there were really friendly.  I asked for my meal to be mild, and there was no spice at all, so next time I'll get medium.  Taste and how it was prepared was excellent.  My wife enjoyed hers as well. As other reviews stated, parking is minimal.  Prepare to pay to park and/or walk as little if you can find a free spot down the side road.  There is a great outdoor area and if it was nice out, I would definitely opt to eat outside.",SSwEefEPfS3OpZQkzQ-ENA,2021-05-01 16:48:25,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Mike

ROTB25QGQ278ZApWTNEvOw,"I have eaten here now a few times. I'd have to say I had a more difficult time coming up with a review than most restaurants because what they do well is very good but there are also some dishes that disappoint. Food: The noodle soup is very good. It is authentic and is like something served in Chicago, NYC, Seattle, etc. The broth is spicy with some sourness and sweetness, going best with ground pork. The laab is also pretty good. Nice and mint forward which is always nice! The thai basil (pad ka prao) is served with minced meat which is the authentic style, however, taste is a bit underwhelming. The chicken satay was pretty bad. The chicken seemed undercooked throughout, rubbery, and was just simply not quality. This is a shame because their peanut sauce is homemade and very tasty. Spring rolls also looked great in presentation but almost seemed store bought with a mushy veg mix inside. Overall very mixed, and a bit disappointed they don't incorporate other authentic dishes such as thai sausage, moo ping, Khao moo dang, Khao mun gai, etc. Drinks: very good. When they mention it is a cocktail lounge with thai food, this is a true statement. The cocktails are nuanced and complex, comparing close to other cocktail lounges in the area. Ambiance and service: both great, they did a fantastic job taking over the old black market and renovating it to their own.",_JMWR5rfgV93Ztd0VGAItw,2021-05-24 01:47:35,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Jake
5ZBLxGhwA_cWWvcGpfmYfg,"This is more of a 2nd visit, rather than an 'update'.  There were a few more items on the menu that I wanted to try, from my first visit.  Again, it was a Friday night, walked in, put my name on the list and returned a hour later, at 8:30 p.m.  I was seated, right in front of the window.  Not much of a view other than the highway on the left.Ordered from the 'Savory Bites''Chicken Skewers'(GAI SATAY | grilled curry chicken | peanut sauce | mini cucumber salad)Main entree from the 'Noodles''Pad Thai'(Rice Noodles | tamarind sauce | egg | peanuts | bean sprouts)First, the 'Chicken Skewers' came out on thin wooden sticks but the meat was rather undercooked, for me, at least.  If you like your meat well done, make sure you advise the server of it.  I didn't finish all of them, the server should have noticed.  It also came with a side of 'Peanut Sauce', for dipping and a 'Mini Cucumber Salad' for a side.  The salad could have been a bigger portion of it.The 'Pad Thai' came out hot, with a generous portion of 'Rice Noodles'.  A little to hot, had to wait for it to cool down.  The noodles were tossed with 'Tamarind Sauce', 'Egg', 'Peanuts' and 'Bean Sprouts' on top.  The tamarind sauce and peanuts came together to add a sweet and sour, tangy note to the noodles.",ilNIxHpVBggkj8_HL9Dz5Q,2021-05-25 05:45:26,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,3,Fahad
bKUPqF9gdoUwePynWpjYUA,"Bodhi has a fun atmosphere, including a patio. Staff is very competent. The neon signs inside are instagrammable as well as their fun cocktail presentations. Like most Thai places, you can choose your spice level. The meals are pretty large, so a typical eater will have a solid lunch leftover box. For the price and the waittimes, I would choose another dinner spot especially for Friday & Saturday. The best time to check out Bodhi is if you go at an unpopular time, like early dinner on Sunday. Parking on the north end of Mass Ave can be tricky, but metered street parking isn't too expensive.",L4yBkaL7YSNpmm9XMaaAGg,2021-11-15 03:14:25,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Barbara
GRyo4VWbWFjiMWfV_wpsRQ,"Looking for something new, my foodie friend discovered this gem on Yelp. The remodeled Black Market space has a nice interior atmosphere & makes better use of the patio than the previous restaurateur. We arrived at 8:50 PM to find the place bustling. We were informed ""last call"" for the kitchen is 9 PM, yet we were promptly seated. There was a delay in getting our order taken, but our server was apologetic & sent a complimentary order of crunchy, delicious spring rolls for our wait (growing pains). My friend had the drunken noodles  & I went with familiar chicken pad Thai . Our cocktails were good. As customers trailed out, the owner  stopped to chat & we complimented the new hideaway at the east end of Mass Ave. The owner explained she, her mother & grandmother have been busy in the kitchen easing into their dine-in opening with a few weeks of carry-out service. She's hopeful to find more staff to help with the obviously successful launch of this Thai restaurant which is designed more as a lounge specializing in craft cocktails, beer & fine wines.

I've had Thai food from many local spots over the last year and Bodhi is far and away the best I've had. I've been twice for carryout so far and both times were amazing - shout out to the Massaman Curry! The interior at this spot is amazing and this space (was formerly Black Market) has the best patio in the city.

D7qm5xmXY6FXS04JtAnkSQ,"Great girls night outing! Bodhi is first come first serve as far as seating so keep that in kind when you choose to go. With that being said, we went around 7pm and there was barely a wait. It appears to be this little hidden gem with a great atmosphere and a nice ambiance. We sat on the patio and it was gorgeous. The specialty drinks are all fun and the menu is well crafted! The portion sizes are huge for the price! We tried the sticky tofu appetizer and I must say the sauce was the true star. The tofu was just the vessel for deliciousness. Lol. The only reason I gave it 4 stars is because the wait between being seated and receiving even drinks was almost 45 minutes. But other than that it was great!",8RuWYcF3oKwugJUjDmQHRg,2021-10-09 13:23:43,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Caitlynn

We started with the golden tofu. It was cooked to perfection, and the accompanying sauce was delightful. I had the Pad See Ewe, which was very flavorful with a few simple ingredients. My friend got the Cashew Stir Fry. She said it was delicious, and the spice level was on point. Portions are a nice size, we both had leftovers. If you're getting an adult beverage I highly recommend the François & Étienne. It's the perfect summer drink, that's not too sweet and very light.

MWUXkYblc-eSTNVGwY-_AQ,"Downtown Indianapolis area really needed a good sit-down Thai restaurant where you can enjoy cocktails too. Happy to see this one on the block! I've been to Bodhi twice now and it's definitely a great place to meet a friend or go on a date. It's fairly quite and is perfect for an intimate dinner. What adds glamor is their decor and extensive bar menu. Parking is a bit tough there but you can find street parking spots within few blocks. I have tried their Tom Yum soup, Drunken Noodles and a Chili Basil Stir Fry and they all tasted delicious. When you ask for medium hot, know that it will be medium hot. They do not underestimate their spice levels. Drunken Noodles was my personal favorite because of their wide rice noodles that are made in-house and taste very fresh. The only issue here is that they only open in the evening and you will often have to wait for 20-30 minutes for a table if you arrive after 6:30pm AND they do not accept reservations. They do have a patio but it's a weather-permitting option, so plan for a wait. They've recently partnered with the Gallery Pastry bar for their dessert selection. In the bar menu, I tried the Thai Iced Tea cocktail and would recommend if you're a Thai iced tea fan in general. It's a bit pricey compared to other Thai restaurants but you will get a great dining experience!",W3_blNjAje8GIX7wRdCgwQ,2021-06-09 01:00:51,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Maks

We sat outside and it has an amazing patio with a fire pit which has lounge chairs around. The we all ordered different meals so we could sample. My fav was the Pad Thai. Nice size portions and very fresh. Many Thai places have noodles that are sticky. Not theirs. Very fresh. Service was amazing, cocktails 10/10.

The interior was designed really well (shoutout Flatland Kitchen) and they did a nice job at socially distancing each group as we dined. It's somewhat difficult to find as there is no visible sign outside but it's basically right across from the hardware store. They also have a lovely patio space that I will definitely be coming back to check out on a nicer + warmer day. It's quite small so I imagine it gets pretty busy on weekends.

There is an outdoor seating area that was super cute, but we were too cold to enjoy it and opted to stay indoors. Our server was super funny and made us laugh the entire time. In fact, everyone at this restaurant was welcoming and super sweet. I ordered the chicken wings  as an appetizer which came with a side of sweet chili sauce. It would have been better if it was tossed in the sauce...but the wings were still good. For dinner, I ordered the mixed veg with chicken and white rice. Listen, the flavor from the chicken was perfect and mixed well with the rice. Everything we ordered was soooo good! I didn't even need to add soy sauce or ask for extra seasoning. I loved the rice so much that I had to try chicken fried rice too! By this time the kitchen had closed but the cooks whipped it up for me anyway...kudos to you!!

FctTh99PwzW9XcjbtS5PhA,"My husband and I went for a date night to Bodhi. They do not take reservations which honestly I feel is very essential during Covid especially that they were not seating at full capacity. We lucked out and were seated in a few minutes but right after us a wait started. I love Thai food so I was excited to try this new addition. It is in the place of where black market used to be. They did some changes in decor and it is an above 21 establishment. The menu has a great variety and is vegetarian friendly as are most Thai places. The bar area and music gave the place a nice vibe, but definitely is not a place to have dinner if you need quiet. The food is a little more pricier than other Thai restaurants. We enjoyed the papaya salad, it had tons of flavor. Spring rolls were good. I like the Tom Yum soup but my husband didn't as he thought it was very salty, we ordered it with tofu which was cut in very large pieces, I wish if they cut it smaller pieces. Chili shrimp was just ok, I was disappointed in that dish as I expected more flavor. Thai green curry with chicken was good but the curry was watered down in my opinion. Our waitress kept saying everything is good and it depends on what you're in a mood for which was not very helpful. I wish if she had explained the menu better.

FpbhvWpkfjMQO4vHI5dUsw,"Let me fully disclose that we met some long time friends for dinner and we had a great time visiting as well as enjoying the friendly service (great job Andrew B) and tasty food.  We had such a fun time that I am sure it puts a positive light on my rating and review.There are a few minor things to be aware of that would make for an even better experience.  First, if I hadn't known from other reviews that this bar bistro was in the former Black Market location, I might not have found it.  The building still says Black Market and I couldn't see anything about Bodhi until I went to the front door.  Another thing to note is that this location suffers from the lack of parking that every other business on Mass Ave has.  We got to the restaurant when it opened at 5 pm on Monday, but their tiny lot was almost full already (we got the last spot.)  I suppose we could have paid for metered parking somewhere along Mass Ave or parked at the parking garage at Bottleworks and walked over.  But be aware that if you are meeting someone, be sure you allot time to find parking.  Our friends arrived a few minutes ahead of us and were able to get a table for four by the windows.  (No reservations are available here.)  For us old folks, having lots of natural light to help read the menus is a plus.  They do have patio seating open but it felt a bit too chilly for us, so we stayed inside.  Our waiter was upbeat and eager to serve and stayed in a positive mood throughout the dinner and cocktails.  I was the only one of our party who was familiar with Thai cuisine, so we needed some time to pick.  We started with our beverages (I got the Emerald Buddha (fresh and crisp cocktail) to start.  They also have a nice lineup of local craft beers on hand.  coke products too.  They didn't have any ice tea made other than Thai tea, so my wife couldn't get an Arnold Palmer drink.  A little disappointed, but not a big deal.We moved on to some starters/shareables.  I ordered the Crab Puffs (think crab rangoon) which my wife declared she would get an order for herself next time and not share.  Served with sweet chili sauce for a sweet heat.  Probably the best rangoon we have had in town!  Highly recommended.  Our friend wanted a cup of Tom Yum soup, but was told it only was served in a large pot that was shareable.  I agreed to help her eat some.  Seems like minor change could be made to accommodate a single consumer.  The waiter said our friend could add a protein and make it her meal as an option, but enough of us agreed to help her eat it and we were brought out bowls and shared it.      My friends like spicy hot food, so I wasn't too concerned, but the website clearly states to not go too hot when ordering.  They can always add more spicy heat (they brought out chili flakes for our friends to add), but can't take it out.  If you order it hot and can't take it, too bad...no refunds on your mistake.  I like that they disclose this ahead of time and encourage people to not overdo the heat request until they are used to the standard heat levels served here.  Having said that, I ordered my items mildly spicy or at most, medium.  Our friends ordered their items medium and requested the pepper flakes, but didn't need many.  Be wise and aware of your options and responsibilities (you pay whether you eat it or not because of the heat level.)  I ordered my standard Pad See Ewe which I get at every Thai restaurant on my first visit so I have a point of comparison between restaurants.  This was delicious and though on the pricy end of the cost spectrum, there was plenty to get a take home box for a second meal.  I've tried making this at home and just the ingredients I purchased on my own make me wonder how a restaurant can charge as little as they do.  I really appreciate great flavor without having to do any of the work myself.  Thanks to the ladies who run the kitchen at Bodhi.  Excellent flavor!  Our friends and my wife ordered different entrees including various stir fry and the drunken noodles.  All reported they enjoyed their meals.  Everyone got take home boxes too.  If you leave her hungry, you must have shared everything or just didn't sample enough of what everyone else ordered!Because I finished my first cocktail while visiting and eating our appetizers, I ordered a tasty Francoise & Etienne cocktail to go with dinner.  It was so good I even ate the orchid and the tangerine ice cubes.  YumHopefully they can find a way to manage parking.  A new hardware store just opened a few weeks ago across the parking lot, so that is going to make parking even more challenging.  If you are young and healthy, I suggest street parking along Mass Ave if you spot a space.  I was hopeful there would be some handicap reserved spaces, but didn't see anything nearby.    I look forward to returning in the near future to try some of the other goodies on their menu and cocktail list.  Review #3904",wXdbkFZsfDR7utJvbWElyA,2021-04-20 12:27:43,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Ken

e5lSEAcOMnLmSnvHP2tHng,"I was looking forward to 'Bodhi', every since I learned it was moving into the former 'Black Market' space.  I did call beforehand but they don't take reservations, it's first come, first served.  It would work even better, if they took reservations.  They are a 21 and over restaurant.  Also, they are closed on Tuesday(s).  It was a Friday night around 8ish, I put my name down on the waitlist but my table wasn't ready until 8:30 that night.  I return around that time and my table was ready.  Also, it still has the 'Black Market' sign on the side of the building.  They have a small parking lot, so parking is bit of a hassle.  The restaurant was almost full, it being a Friday night.For appetizers, I ordered from the 'Savory Bites''BODHI Spring Rolls'(POR PIA TOD | crunchy vegetables | glass noodles | sweet plum sauce)For the entree, 'Curries''Yellow Curry'(GAENG GARI SPAGHETTI | bone-in chicken or tofu | onion | spaghetti noodles)The 'Bodhi' Spring Rolls were filled with vegetables and noodles with a side of 'Sweet Plum' sauce for dipping.  The rolls were rather thin and could have been filled with more vegetables or noodles.The 'Yellow Curry' came out with two pieces of 'Bone-in Chicken' and topped with 'Onions'.  It was rather, a small portion.  The curry came with a side of 'Spaghetti Noodles', I didn't know how to eat noodles with a curry, so I ordered a side of 'Steamed Jasmine Rice'.  It was one the best curries, I have ever had!  It was spicy enough for me but it might be too spicy for someone who isn't Asian.  After I finished the rice, I dipped some of the noodles in the curry.",ilNIxHpVBggkj8_HL9Dz5Q,2021-05-04 05:34:22,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Fahad

BEt7pZwza4U4xoNV-dG5Bw,"Tried this place with my fiancé last night. The wait did not take too long (hostess said 30min, but it was more like 15) and we sat outside on their nice patio.I tried the stir fried flat noodles and my fiancé had the roasted chili shrimp stir fry- both rated ""mild"" on the menu and I asked the waiter if he could make sure mine was more on the mild side. I'm not sure if there was a mix up, but my dish was nearly inedible from how spicy it was! Luckily my fiancé prefers spicy food and we were able to switch meals (which is perplexing as they were rated the same level of hot and his was fine).We let the waiter know, and he and another person offered to make us the same dish, which was considerate (we declined). I think we'll give it another chance in the future, but definitely a little wary given the wide range of mild between two dishes rated the same, which is disappointing considering the price point.",cxVI4M-cos8B9BXlOo8HmA,2021-05-30 15:36:22,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,3,Katie
rTr8uCoOzb4MhwV1YFy8Jg,"I was torn on how many stars to give this review and decided it was a toss up between a 2+ and 3- because treating people rudely when they don't deserve it is never ""ok"" in my book...on to my review.     A foodie friend who periodically organizes dinners out at various restaurants heard about Bodhi and, after reading the excellent reviews, arranged for a group of us to visit on April 7, 2021 for drinks and dinner. Since no reservations are taken upon her arrival my friend advised the hostess that we were a party of 10 and being familiar with Covid restrictions she told the hostess we were more than willing to split up and maintain social distancing guidelines so we could be seated in the restaurant as it was early evening and a bit chilly out on the patio. (At that point, the restaurant was virtually empty.) Her request was denied and actually my friend was treated rudely enough by the hostess that when I pulled up, she was getting into her vehicle and driving away.     She explained later that the hostess insisted that if our group wanted to sit together we would have to be seated on the patio at one of their larger tables. When I arrived, I was led to our table by the hostess who greeted me pleasantly.  Knowing we were going to be more than 6 I was confused by the seating arrangements because there was a different party of two at the end of that table and with the 6' between parties rule most of the table had to remain empty (expecting 10 and only room for 6). It made no sense for the hostess to have seated us there when there was a second large table right behind us that was empty of diners!!! Seems the hostess was more comfortable causing our party difficulties than ensuring we had a nice dining experience.      Everyone in our party witnessed the hostile attitude of the hostess because one of us arrived when she had apparently left the stand and finding nobody there, he came in, found us and sat down next to me (unfortunately for him in the ""forbidden zone"") and we started talking. Having been alerted an additional member of our group arrived, she hustled out there and rather than apologizing for the seating confusion and offering to move us to the larger table she chastised him at length over Covid restrictions. So, our party of 10 had now been pared down to 7 and that was only because we suggested moving the 7th person to the head of our table.      Having worked in customer service for many years this is not how you treat people if you want them to patronize your establishment. No one in our group appreciated this type of treatment. No, we were not arguing about Covid restrictions - our problem was with YOU insisting we sit on the patio then HASSLING us for sitting at the table YOU put us at after being told the size of our party and failing to simply move us to an empty, available table to maintain social distancing from another party...pretty simple solution, right?     The upside to our Bodhi dining experience is those that got their dishes made the way they ordered them had positive things to say. Personally, I had ordered the Chili & Basil stir fry mild and asked for some of the peppers to spice the dish to my liking which never made it to the table and it took real persistence on my part to get some to go so I could appropriately spice the dish at home. The crab puffs were crispy like normal crab rangoon, but the filling was extra creamy and delicious. The fruit salad dessert was tasty with a custard like bottom layer. The chef described how it was made when it was delivered to the table. It was clear that she really cared about the food she was preparing and that people unfamiliar with some of the ingredients used in Thai cooking were educated about them.     There were some issues with the spice levels of a couple of the dishes. One diner ordered the Chili & Basil stir fry at the 3-heat level, but her dish arrived mild and she was disappointed it was ""bland"". There was also an issue with the Sweet and Sour Chicken dish that was ordered mild (with some additional modifications) and ended up being so spicy she couldn't eat it. Although the dish was remade the replacement included the green peppers she originally requested be left out. She ate it anyway because her appetizer had been forgotten and she had to be very insistent with our waiter to get it delivered out to the table.     Apparently they are still working out the kinks on everything from where to seat people, how to get food out to diners at the same time (or at least close to the same time) and how to turn over tables quickly - we waited 15 minutes on our checks after we requested them, then had to flag down our waiter (who was less than attentive to our party - don't know whether they were understaffed that evening or what) to get them and had to tell him what we ordered because he ""didn't remember who ordered what"" which was a bad way to end the evening as it wasn't exactly sitting out on the patio weather to begin with.",4PFbbN4O46xtNG1rc5AWTg,2021-04-14 22:38:52,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,3,Cynthia

We dined in their outdoor area, which is pretty large and makes you want to spend hours out there sipping cocktails and conversing with friends. The food was good, but we thought it wasn't very spicy (even when it was ordered as ""hot"").

Parking is getting a bit tricky on Mass Ave but we found a paid street parking spot a couple of blocks away. Good vibes only at Bodhi! It feels light and airy yet welcoming and cozy. I love a brick interior. We were fascinated and super impressed by the plant wall. How do they keep all those beauties looking so fresh? Magic. Speaking of magic...get the crab puffs. They are so delicious that we got a second order. They put all other crab Rangoon to shame. You'll never look at a takeout rangoon the same again. Seriously. They were crispy and the crab was fresh. Just get them and you'll see. We also shared the spring rolls and the lemon grass soup with tofu. The lemongrass soup tasted like it had been cooking all day. Just delicious.

XuzOfWnItzGPs7HDsETCiA,"Unequivocally the finest Asian dining in Indianapolis. Authentic Thai cuisine, nestled in the (gorgeous) old Black Market, with amazing service! After a dozen+ trips here, officially my new favorite restaurant in Indiana. Pro-Tip: No reservations so come early or drop your name an hour before you plan to eat & go chill at Pins till they text you (they text you a link to monitor wait time).Amazing Food... The proprietor's mother runs the kitchen, and she runs a tight ship. You can peep in and watch the magic happen. I've lived in Asia / backpacked a decent chunk of my mother-continent, and can honestly everything here is very authentic. I usually start with the Fired Tofu for my starter, its got a perfect crisp & the peanut sauce isn't too sweet. For entrees, if you only order one... ORDER DRUNKEN NOODLES! The texture of the drunken noodles aka pad kee mao are incredible here, perfectly chewy but doesn't stick to your teeth. The flavors are very nice, solid blend of sweetness & spice (I advise mild heat). The curries are all very well executed but I default to the Massaman + Naan. Not spicy and has a very intense flavor profile for peanut lovers. The super tender carrots and potatoes really soak in the flavor.Amazing Service... The wait staff here is all phenomenal, I have yet to have a bad experience even with large groups! I have had a group of 8, taking over the booths on the right with no drop off in service quality. The owner ""leads from the front"", constantly on her feet and you'll often see her clearing tables too, can't say enough how smooth the front of house is run!Awesome Value... You're only spending about 50% more here per plate than you would in a run down strip mall on Lafayette Road and you're getting fresh ingredients prepared in a much more refined kitchen. With all the entrees under $20, this place is an absolute bargain. The portion sizes are generous but I advise over-ordering, most of the food reheats very well.",5kL_t1bDR4HLDq_xNo5KZw,2021-08-02 13:02:25,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Roger

We shared the spring rolls which were amazing. They were so flavorful and had the best crispy outside. We were told they're rolled by the owners grandmother everyday! For dinner I had the yellow curry with rice instead of noodles. Y'all! This chicken was amazing! It just fell off the bone and the curry sauce was the perfect pairing. It was not too spicy but had enough to balance the sweetness of the carrots. The waiter said this was his favorite dish.,1OIgrA0fLHOxvRCsPjKdYw,2021-11-20 23:13:30,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Claire

I'll start with the food, which was good but not great - especially in comparison to other popular local Thai spots like Siam Square, Thaitanium, etc. We preferred the spring rolls to start, which came out crazy fast (like 3-4 minutes after we ordered) but lacked a ton of great flavor. My entree was the drunken noodles, a typically reliable favorite for me to try at new Thai restaurants, but I was very disappointed. It also lacked much flavor, and the ratio/construct of the dish was off to me - it was VERY vegetable heavy (over half the plate was veggies). The noticeable lack of noodles and protein (chicken) had it tasting more like a veggie stir fry with a few noodles and a couple pieces of chicken added, than an actual noodle dish. I'll also point out that the service we received was not very welcoming or friendly, even when we identified ourselves as first time customers. The gentleman (I can't remember his name, but he was wearing hipster-esque sunglasses inside) serving us was standoffish and cold. I'm not sure if that was an intentional vibe he was trying to put off; if so, he successfully made us feel like we were an unwanted part of his job. Where Bodhi excels (and boosts itself from a 3 star ranking to a 4) is the cocktails and atmosphere. There are a number of great drink options, unlike the other local Thai options, and the space itself is very cool. I wish we would've had a chance to sit outside as that patio looked awesome on a cool summer evening. If you're more looking for a cool spot to sit outside and have drinks with Thai menu options, Bodhi is your spot. If you're looking for a high quality Thai meal (no drinks) or a great takeout choice, I would look elsewhere. I might be back.",Km-4eUhbjkLNYL-cETbeNg,2021-09-13 12:04:17,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Drew

To our pleasant surprise, it was an appetizer only night because the kitchen was closed to provide their staff with much needed time off (can't applaud them enough for that!)The crab puffs were delightful. I ordered a drink that seemed to be a Thai spin on a French 75. Can't wait to go back and try the full menu!",NbSUtgba5SW4uBWXfEedNw,2021-10-06 04:30:41,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Hayden

ait1HDCjr49UAYuby05iDw,"In the quest for finding the best thai food, I decided to try Bodhi! I got the drunken noodles and they were pretty decent. I wish it had a better spice to it but nothing a spice tray can't fix. The tofu itself was also pretty good in the dish. I also really like their rotating drinks that they bring in. Overall, I think their drinks are key. The atmosphere here is awesome as well. Whether you are inside or outside, good vibes all around. I will say I sat outside in the direct sun and definitely was sweating. Overall, I love this place for drinks, but potentially can work on the Thai food. Would love to see a little bit more well spiced dishes in the future.",SIpwJauwHleShzfbw5NDEg,2021-09-17 14:13:08,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Vraj

I have to say, the Francois and Etienne was AMAZING, and I don't usually enjoy gin. For dinner, we shared the spring rolls and pork skewers. I would buy the peanut sauce (from the pork skewers) in a bowl, it was fantastic. My husband got the pad Thai extra spicy () and I got the cashew stir fry with chicken (mild). Let's just say I could taste the flavors in mine, and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend this restaurant, even if you are not familiar with Thai food.

The kitchen was about to close. Oh the kitchen closes at 9 when the restaurant closes at 10. We both ordered the same spice level on our food but somehow mine was spicier. I think because I got noodles and he got panang curry.  The rice cuts the spice some. The flavors of these two dishes were great. Our server and service was pretty nice as well. Good vibes.

If you'd ever been to Black Market, you know the space is very small and intimate and that fact has not change. Actually, the place pretty much looks the same except for a few minor decor changes like a greenery wall with neon signage and light up Bodhi letters. The Bodhi website says they don't take reservations, so I was a bit confused when we arrived on a Friday night, saw multiple empty tables, but were told there was an hour wait (maybe they were waiting for parties to walk back over). Despite the hour wait, we put our name on the waitlist and went for a drink nearby. After about 45 minutes we received a text saying our table was ready and headed back over. The hostess and our waiter were both very pleasant, our food came quickly and everything was tasty. I'd say the appetizers were the best part. The Drunken Noodles were good and on par with many others I've had and enjoyed, but I'm not going to say they were anything special. There are many options on the menu and I look forward to returning to try another noodle dish and/or a curry option and a cocktail.",j7QHFb_7N2PTz0XW6kED3Q,2021-12-22 03:09:30,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Antonia

2rIRm8DXfbhkZUepwmHUxw,"Bodhi is absolutely phenomenal! Mass Ave needed this Thai Bistro. Nestled at the very end of Mass Ave - this spot is far enough from the busiest part of the strip that when you sit in their outdoor space, it does not feel like you're sitting on one of the busiest streets downtown. We came on a Friday evening and were promptly seated outside! The outdoor space is cozy and warm with twinkly lights, a fire pit, and sofa chairs. Upon receiving our menus, we noticed they had both an extensive drink and food menu. With it being our first time here, we let our server Alex guide us on which specialty cocktails to go for. We ended up with the seasonal cocktails: Kinnaree and Seven Realms of Happiness. Both were so good we got a second round! The flavors and ingredients tasted so fresh and really meshed together. Very refreshing drinks to have on a warm Spring day sitting in the sun! For the food, we got an order of crab puffs. Then ordered the Shrimp Drunken Noodles and Chicken Panang Curry. My favorite crab puff used to be at a different restaurant, but since having the crab puff at Bodhi, I have a new favorite! Again, it has everything to do with how flavorful and fresh the food tastes. Their crab puffs are stuffed perfectly and crisped to perfection. Next, our entrees came out piping hot and were the perfect spice level. Personally, I think this is the best curry I have ever had in downtown Indy. We did not get dessert but we will definitely be getting some the next time we are in. The final big compliment I have is for the staff. Everyone is so kind and welcoming. You can tell by the way the staff interacts with the customers and by how amazing everything (from the cocktails to apps to entrees) that they truly care about their craft! Our server Alex was so helpful, and we loved that he just let us relax and enjoy our time. Bodhi came to me highly recommended, and I am passing on that sentiment - go, you will not regret it!

We also had an appetizer that we shared & had to ask for plates for it. We sat at the plant wall at the front of the restaurant, which is beautiful but the plants hung down kind of low & tickled my hair the whole time. The  atmosphere is nice.

We got there at 9:30 and were told kitchen closes at 10:00 and they couldn't serve us. Next time we showed up pretty early and they told us they didn't have any seating for us. Finally, after I told them it was our anniversary, they gave us a tiny table outside but warned it was going to rain. It did start raining at the end of the meal, but at least we got to eat. As I said, the food was excellent. For this reason, we've gotten to-go twice because we didn't want to hassle with being told we couldn't be seated again. Tonight we called to order to-go again and we are told they're not doing to-go orders tonight due to being a little short-staffed. We only wanted to order one order of fried rice, but we had to end up settling for the Thai restaurant on the south side which isn't anywhere near as good. I'm not sure how long they'll stay in business at Bodhi with their lack of seating and not even having to-go available.

The hostess then said it would be about 20 minutes before we had a table so we should be okay to order food.  My husband joked and said he would hope so 'cause that would give the kitchen 40 minutes to cook.  He was not rude at all.  He even giggled when he said it. The hostess had obviously had a bad day or was just a mean little person because she asked us to leave and took the menu away.

NaVawGpraOthU9Ej6xOXkA,Great experience at Bodhi last night. It's a very busy and popular place so expect a wait. We were starved so we started with the crab puffs. There were 7 very full crab puffs! The sauce it came with was made from scratch and had a little bit of extra heat that paired perfectly with the sweet puffs. I ordered the Bloom to Bloom drink after I read the story behind it. The cool presentation was a bonus! I got the massaman curry which is not my typical order at a Thai place but it came highly recommended. It was perfect! It comes with naan instead of rice. Perfect sop up the delicious curry. It's very hearty and would be good in winter with the braised beef. My husband usually gets red curry but they do not have that type. He got the panang curry which was missing the usual red chili heat. It still got the job done. Can't wait to go back!,Rrn9cVrMwabelCrzZHAofg,2021-07-03 16:10:59,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Laurel

They have an outdoor space that's so well done but truly the inside is just as cute. As some people would say ""Instagram worthy.""Bow onto the food - HUGE portions! You could definitely split any of the entres. I love pad Thai and their pad Thai is one of the best I've had in Indy. I got medium heat, I feel like I could have gone all the way since pad Thai sauce usually calms the heat. Appetizers deforest the fried tofu and absolutely the crab Rangoon (some of the best).They have a huge list of beers and crafty cocktails. You can order pretty much whatever drink your heart desires.Enjoy :)",fwYfmR59scyAzpGgZEKJKQ,2021-09-24 00:59:17,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,5,Dani

kxVRc4ZZ8X0BUn4okT-72A,"At the end of Mass Ave, Bodhi sits in the brick building. I hope they work on a sign for the side of the building, but the door has the business name so you know you are in the right place. We went on a Monday night for a birthday dinner, and wow this place was busy! There is proper spacing inside, but we came in at the right time as after us there was a good wait.Savory Bites: We started off with the Crab Puffs, which are equivalent to crab rangoons. That sweet chili sauce is amaaaazing.Drinks: I got the Thai Iced Tea which hit the spot. They also have a cocktail version that intrigues me, will try next time. My boyfriend got a cocktail - and apologies, I can't remember the name and the cocktail menu is not online. It was basically a boozy lemon lime soda, tasty. They were quite backed up at the bar and we didn't get our drinks until after our Crab Puffs were finished. It seemed like everyone came at once and I can't fault the bartender for that, but perhaps someone needs to be cross trained to jump in.Entrees: Each entree has a RECOMMENDED spice rating, you still get to pick the spiciness level unless there is a * which means mild is not available. I got the Green Curry which was borderline too spicy for me personally at the Medium level. It wasn't my favorite green curry I've had, but that doesn't mean I didn't enjoy it. I loved the plating for it! My boyfriend got the Pad Thai and it was delicious.It definitely seems like the new hot spot. Will be looking to circle back at some point and try some of their noodle dishes, and one of those craft cocktails!",hinrYC95HxT8V2wupp0LvA,2021-04-01 14:52:57,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,Brittany

I've never ever sent anything back before, but when I ordered a cocktail that I truly did not like, he was wonderful and swapped it out for me.  The only bad thing was the mezcal cocktail which three people at my table did not like at all (it was extra smoky, in a sort of artificial way). Everything else was fantastic! The other two cocktails were delicious, especially the Seven Realms of Heaven. I ordered the Tom Yum soup because I've heard it's an extremely popular Thai dish, and it was delicious and served in a beautiful bowl. The crab wontons we're also great and way more flavorful than the kind you'd order at a cheap Chinese restaurant.

FMvfk9YTgKLV4w2EC72vDA,"This little gem is at the end of Mass Ave. Unfortunately, they do not take reservations and the restaurant is small, so be prepared for a wait. Luckily, my husband and I went as a party of 2 so we were able to get seated at the bar relatively quickly (~20 min wait). Nonetheless, I do feel it is worth the wait. It's a very cute and small restaurant that serves nice sized portions and great drinks. As an appetizer, we ordered the crab puffs which are crab rangoon. They were decent but nothing special..not sure if I would order them again. For the entree, my  husband and I ordered the drunken noodle to share. When asked how spicy I told them medium but I believe they made them hot instead. I have a pretty good tolerance for spicy foods, but my husband couldn't tolerate it at all. For those who have a lower tolerance for spicy foods, beware and maybe stick with the mild (or no heat if that's an option), just in case. Aside from that mixup, the dish was great. The flavor of the noodles with the chicken added in were delicious.  My husband had to order a second dish to eat and ended up getting Pad Thai...he absolutely loved it.

TEgnDXw67atDSI1iMq5clQ,"Long time lurker, first time poster.I'm excited to write my first review on a restaurant which didn't do everything perfectly, but I am ready to chalk it up to my poor decisions and new restaurant kinks and am already excited to visit again soon.Going on a Wednesday evening, the wait wasn't too terrible for a party of three, but luckily with the new Bottleworks nearby, finding a side activity or place to drink is pretty easy.Let's get to my least favorite things about this experience, cocktails and the appetizer. My cocktail was the Emerald Buddha, which was a vodka cocktail with lime and orange crema and lemongrass syrup among other garnishes. While the cocktail descriptor was far more eloquent, the drink was mediocre at best. It certainly didn't burn like a cheap vodka drink, but for all sorts of descriptors, the flavor should have been more robust than a bland citrusy vodka and tonic. Their beer list seemed pretty decent in regards to selection and variety, so this likely will be my drink choice for my next visit.The crab puffs were shared amongst our table, but they were really uninspiring, especially as a connoisseur of Chinese buffets. Maybe I was foolish for expecting something different.Luckily my Massaman curry hit out of the park. It was a ""spicy"" heat level, but blended the nutty sweetness, intense spices, and the richness of the coconut milk and braised beef that I added to it.Most importantly, our wonderful server, Austin, checked in on us appropriately throughout our night and joined our conversations seamlessly.",lbQ82wqC9Ax2FI03qJB5oQ,2021-05-23 13:31:04,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,4,An

eOzbzMWhrKVA6SLj58PmqQ,"TL;DR - Good, but somewhat forgettable. Skip the pad thai, definitely order a seasonal cocktail, and be prepared to wait. Pros: The service was wonderful and the drinks blew us away. I got a Thai Iced Tea that was wonderful and my partner ordered an Old Fashioned. The staff was incredibly friendly and sociable. Also, they offer a digitized wait list so that you can see where your party is at on the wait list and how long you've been waiting. Cons: The food didn't live up to the hype. It was good food, don't get me wrong, but my expectations were pretty high after hearing raving reviews from others. Also, we were quoted a 25-30 minute wait and we ended up waiting almost an hour. It's a pretty small place and it doesn't take reservations. While they do offer a digital, real-time wait list that you can view on your phone to see your place in line, the digital wait list doesn't provide a time estimate for the wait.

It has veggies and glass noodles and are served with a sweet sauce. The shrimp cocktail is very delicious as well but I must say, the sauce it comes with is spicy! Both times I've gotten a variation of the OG Bodhi friend rice at a medium heat and I cannot express enough how delicious it is. The drinks are very fancy and pricey but will get you giggly. The vibes at this restaurant are very laid back, perfect for going with friends or on a date! I've sat outside both times and usually they have the fire pit going and cute little lights lit up outside. It's an experience and an honestly delicious place to try Thai food.

I recommend trying the signature Thai Iced Tea cocktail. Its a brilliant twist on one of my favorite drinks. It is a 21+ establishment, so it's perfect for a kid free occasion. Its no small feat to open a restaurant downtown, let alone during a global pandemic with so many extra precautions to take into account.

My boyfriend took me for my birthday last Thursday, and I honestly cannot wait to go back!! So we called the night before to make a reservation and unfortunately they don't take them. Planned on going early but some work stuff came up so we didn't get there until 7ish. They told us to eat inside it would be about 45-60 min, I didn't want to be cold in their outdoor area so we decided to wait and grabbed a drink nearby. After already waiting an hour we came back hoping our table would soon be ready. It's such a fun little space with great cocktail that the tables weren't turning. There we're three chairs we could wait on while waiting for the table and the hostess gave us a cocktail menu to get a drink. Gosh all their cocktails are SO FUN! I loved the two I had. Finally a table opened up and we got their order of spring rolls to start. They were so great and I especially loved the plum sauce that came with it. Now listen up, the main course is why I'll be trying to visit this place monthly. I love Massaman Curry and order it at every Thai restaurant I ever go to- this is the best I've ever had outside of Thailand! The flavor was just out of this world! It came with a side of naan bread, I honestly think I would have preferred rice I read to soak up all that incredible sauce. We would have stayed four dessert but it was already getting close to 10 and I had an early morning the next morning. Can't wait to go back.

After looking at the menu, I still did not know what to order. When our waiter came, I asked for a cocktail and an entree recommendation. He asked me a couple questions about what I normally like, and found both a cocktail and an entree for me that were absolutely amazing.

XD6Jtcl_BBudsB-oIMcgTQ,"BODHI was just alright for me. I saw the high ratings and had higher expectations. We came on a Saturday night so it could have also played a factor in our experience.They don't take reservations so it was first come first serve walk in only. We probably waited close to 40-50 mins for our party of two.Once we were seated and placed our order, we probably waited another good 40-45 mins for our food to arrive.The laab salad was pretty good. I would probably order it again. My original intent was to order a papaya salad, but they said the owner who makes the dressing has been out and they were not able to sell it. I munched on the laab salad and another 30 minutes went by before our entrees arrived. I ordered the Tom kha soup with chicken. This one was just alright. Tasted mediocre. I've had Tom kha at so many different restaurants that this one really doesn't stand out. There was a candle underneath the pot, but other restaurants will serve it in an actual burner pot like for hot pot. The hype of BODHI is that it's on Massachusetts Ave and it's convenient and has a trendy interior and patio. Would I come back? If my group wants to go, I oblige, but I would probably not go out of my way to come here. Everything took way too long and was just mediocre.

WFL1ZdNQ13cuKCN83Wb6MA,"Overall, our group enjoyed our experience at BODHI. It's an attractive space, the table service was great, the drink menu is extensive, and the food was tasty. The criticisms I have that make this a 3-star review are all likely a result of growing pains, but need to be addressed nonetheless.When we first walked in the door, we stood at the host stand for a solid 5 minutes or so without being acknowledged by anyone in any way. I believe the person who was acting as host was also the manager and also trying to help with running food, which is understandable. The bigger issue is that there were plenty of other employees around who definitely were aware of us and didn't bother to tell us that someone would be with us shortly. That's pretty fundamental training to provide to your restaurant staff so that someone doesn't feel ignored at a host stand long enough to start to wonder if they're in the right spot or if you need to seat themselves. Ultimately, not a huge deal, but not a great start.After we put our names in, we supplied our phone number and were told that it would be an hour wait. No problem. We wandered over to the nearby food hall and grabbed a drink. I started to get nervous around the hour mark though and suggested to our group that we head back and check on the table just in case. When we got back, we were told that our table was ready, and the host seemed concerned that we hadn't received a call. Again, not a huge deal, and likely not anyone's fault in the restaurant. But this is for sure something that needs to be figured out.When we sat down, our server greeted us relatively quickly given how busy he was, and we were all excited by both the food and drink menus. We ordered our drinks and asked questions about the standards they use to set the spice levels (spicy food lovers know why this is important!). We also ordered an appetizer that our server forgot to enter in and didn't come out until after our entrees had. Another small but not ideal issue.The final concern is probably the most relevant to people looking to eat here. While our server did a great job explaining the spice levels, when our food came out, the heat was very inconsistent between the dishes. Their spice levels are indicated by a chili pepper symbol with the following scale:1-Mild2-Medium3-Spicy4-Extra SpicyEveryone in our group wanted a good amount of spice in their food, but didn't want it overly intense. We were told a 3 would be that range, so we all ordered 3 across two orders of drunken noodles, one panang curry, and one chili & basil stir fry.My friend had the curry, and I had the stir fry. We both like a good amount of spice and were struggling just a few bites into our meal. The food was good enough that we both finished, but we hadn't wanted to be that uncomfortable as we ate. Meanwhile, our partners who had both gotten the drunken noodles didn't feel that their dishes were very spicy at all. Now, you could chalk this up to spice levels affecting dishes differently, which happens, but it didn't even seem to be consistent between them. I tasted my wife's (I should clarify that I tasted her leftovers the next day since I was in no position to gauge a lack of spice during our meal!), and it was more in line with what I would have wanted at a 3. Meanwhile, the other person in the group that had ordered the noodles said it was barely spicy at all. This is something that definitely needs to be sorted because food being more or less spicy than you like is a potentially meal-ruining experience.Everything said, there's nothing that we didn't enjoy about our experience here that can't be fixed. We look forward to coming back after a while and trying it again. Might ask if they can do 2.5 chilis...",coT2IttQ8H3Gch6zjkR9-Q,2021-04-07 13:55:37,rR30b1XWbxZFFgLyGbfNAw,3,Pat

I had heard such great things about this place, but the unprofessionalism and health safety concerns were too much to not share. If you don't read this entire review, just know: Do NOT come here if there's even a chance of rain! They sat us outside right before a thunderstorm. When we asked what they were planning on doing as we had just got there when it started raining, they told us we were welcome to stand in the doorway and eat our food standing (?). I felt bad for my server who was clearly flustered and had no idea what to do. When we stood in the doorway, the bartender told us that we couldn't stay in there and was confused that someone had told us we could. Back out in the rain we went. Our server told us that there was a spot underneath a birds nest we could sit at but warned us about the bird crap. There was dried bird crap next to us on our table that they didn't bother to wipe up. Before we left they gave us literal dish towels to put on our heads. Food was pricey but good.

KbrboYzDHpW19YXYL98R0Q,"Come for cocktails on the patio.  The food is ok at best and overpriced for average Thai which typically is made from fresh ingredients most anywhere.  I guess I was expecting a unique spin on Thai food...some sort of fusion or not regular items you'd find at every other Thai restaurant around.  Highly recommend the specialty cocktails...the Phaya Naga is fantastic (if you like a good smoky mezcal cocktail)!  We ordered the spring rolls, drunken noodles and massaman curry.  The spring rolls and drunken noodles were nothing to write home about and were actually not as good as the ones we had gotten when we ordered takeout from Thai Garden in Fishers a week earlier.  The drunken noodles were very light on noodles...perhaps since the flat noodles are house made, they skimp on the portion served.  I had never tasted a massaman curry...the braised beef was tender and perfectly braised, however I didn't care for the sweetness in the spices of that particular curry.Came during off peak on a Wednesday around 5:30 to beat the long wait times since they don't take reservations and we were seated right away.
