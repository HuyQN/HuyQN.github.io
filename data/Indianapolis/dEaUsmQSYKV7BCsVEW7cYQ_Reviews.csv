NwmuUYu8D6lU6d2C5d_mug,Chef Gulley really takes the time to ensure your food is a wonderful experience with every bite. Their healthy food bowl concept is amazing. I recommend everyone trying either the cheesesteak egg rolls or the Buffalo chicken egg rolls. Now the food will take about 15-20 minutes cause she makes it fresh. Strongly recommend this place.,UGSTQ3LCpViNk6NQ-zunlA,2021-09-15 23:26:12,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Donte
RUNc-dJqSnmas0pkiUSAXA,"Very good and healthy too!!!!  I had the Saba with quinoa and black beans.  Husband had the chicken and he loved as well.  For him to comment that we'd drive back over here just for this place, says a lot!!!",OIRTcpBZp_ykH9L4m1Ox7g,2021-09-12 16:21:34,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Teri

yVlMoqOqjHYZtU9lavF7aw,"Went here off of the recommendation from another AMP vendor and this may be my new favorite restaurant in Indy. The food is delicious! I found out about them 2 weeks ago and I've been back 3-4 times since. Super flavorful and, for the most part, healthy. Their build your own hibachi bowls are all healthy options/ingredients (I have my favorite combo pictured) but they also have a cheat menu that include Philly cheesesteak egg rolls. I've been wanting to try these forever and Healthy Soul's do not disappoint. They are jumbo so they're perfect to split, whereas the bowls are more of an individual item (you may have leftovers if you have a smaller appetite). The prices may seem on the higher end at first look but the food is worth it. I will be a repeat customer and could not recommend this restaurant more.",Aof2HDKt8fryyIB9IeoTGg,2021-09-04 22:25:28,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Nae
4pKpTUx9aNjnu0Znj-LsHQ,"By far, one of the best-seasoned and flavorful meals I've had eating out. I went out to check out the AMP Artisan Marketplace at 16 Tech and the atmosphere was laid back, hardly any people. Surprising since it was Saturday. Walked around and thought this place was gonna hit the spot and I was blown away. The people there were so kind and ready to share about the food. Easy base, went with the red quinoa, added carrots and the market veggie (corn). Went with chicken as a protein and chose sweet chili sauce, extra spicy. Such easy ingredients and you could tell they were FRESH and really well seasoned- incredible depth of flavor. I will definitely be returning and highly recommend you check this place out!",APF9vbuLMpGy0qpofYjETQ,2021-07-18 14:45:28,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Luz
D9h855Zo48GMU5wD8yPWYw,"Delicious, and of course healthy, soul food. The menu is pretty self explanatory and the items were so fresh and tasty. The chicken was so well seasoned. I loved the avocado creama sauce. I wish I could get that bottled. My mom got the egg rolls and they were HUGE. Definitely worth checking out inside of the AMP",AHtFLOEjeud9A9DcpTOb0A,2021-11-13 18:41:04,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Staci
kpks3Sxpwmie05bvcjnuqw,"Chef Tawana does it again! Healthy Soul Indy is conveniently located inside The AMP food hall at 16 Tech. This is a food hall and marketplace for the community. A great option when you can't agree on a meal for a date or just out with a friend or something. Indecisive much? Then The AMP Food hall is for you! I first met Chef Tawana during a Yelp cooking class over Zoom last year and she taught us how to prepare a healthy fried rice at home. I made a point that I would make her restaurant my first Yelp review of 2022! Lucky me that today they had a House Fried Rice Special that I could try on the menu made by the chef herself!This is a great option for lunch or an early dinner. You can order from the two specials of the day or a la carte based on the menu options that is a build your own style (pick your base, protein, veggies, etc.) I selected something familiar and that I knew I would enjoy but everything on the menu sounds delicious. There is an option to order a drink or water. I went with the Jarritos fruit punch since they did not have the house made lemonade available today. My food took about 15-20 minutes to prepare and they put it in a cardboard food box, with plastic utensils to go. She prepares your food right in front of you as the grill and cooking area is right behind the counter. It's inspiring to see her in the zone and the smell is intoxicating in a good way!My food was nice and hot and they put a healthy portion to eat half now and eat half later if you have a small stomach capacity like myself. There were two house made sauces along with the rice, chicken, shrimp, broccoli, onions, and other goodies. I would highly recommend taking a stop here. Thank you Chef Tawana for also stopping by my table and asking how everything was, that was very courteous. Top notch customer service.01/15/22 - Jackie M.",AL6dG9WaR3VdpNQTBjov0w,2022-01-16 03:29:43,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Jackie
umOxL7bnvCEVRzGdx4eYTg,"So I thought I would try the Artisan Market Place (AMP)  this past Thursday for lunch. After looking around the whole narket I decided to eat lunch at Healthy Soul.  On their choose-n-go menu you pick a base, 2 veggies, and a sauce for $8. If you like you can add in a grilled marinated protein for an additional cost. This was the main menu but they did have other options such as egg rolls. I chose red quinoa as my base, carrots and seasoned zucchini/squash, and then Katsu bourbon as my sauce. I added in the salmon.They told me it would be about 15 minutes and that is about what I waited.When I received my meal in a box I found a seat at the Hiatus Bar to eat. When I opened the box the smell of the food was fantastic and it was beautiful! I then started digging in and if this is healthy food I could eat this on the daily. It was freaking delicious.I highly recommend going to Healthy Soul and I will definitely be back to try a different dish.",INQotNgqr7-Q8e2o7X0uBA,2021-12-05 16:12:10,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,5,Tyanna
la5roBiH3YH2xjcPek8QGg,"It is located in the back, far left corner.  I was greeted with a smile and the lady who took my order was very helpful.  I must say that I love the food.  I would go everyday if so lived closer.  I purchased the lamb and salmon bowls.  They were to die for!",_xls8a1gV5ieMmvX0louTg,2021-07-08 18:11:55,dEaUsmQSYKV7BCsVEW7cYQ,4,Natasha
