We tried the pambazo, three different type of their chicharrón prensado gorditas, and two of their aguas frescas. Everything was delicious and you can tell everything is made fresh. The flavor is 10/10!The owners are extremely nice and welcoming. We can't wait to be back to try everything else on the menu.",Fqw2lHV3VH4huYj_DY4HgQ,2021-08-20 23:57:51,jqnl080wAOhOhyCMrYddhw,5,Lizeth
T_fIT1KPXu28EHpCwr_6hg,The food was great and so was the service. There are lots of options for Mexican food in the area but this may be the best! We will be back soon.,k2wui3lRinawz_plpf0gaw,2021-08-10 23:21:54,jqnl080wAOhOhyCMrYddhw,5,Douglas

LSEGOP9kXjIjxjhObsQH7w,This is a new restaurant that just opened...I heard of this place so I wanted to try it. We loved it! The menu has unique dishes from southern Mexico we loved trying. The place was very clean and the business owner was very attentive. She used her own family recipes and runs her business with a lot of Care and hospitality. We will definitely be coming back! The food was delicious and so fresh. We loved it and were full when we left.,2CPRNyZrNFyr4ZAtVjBWkg,2021-08-07 00:16:10,jqnl080wAOhOhyCMrYddhw,5,Natalia
8LB4VEdSKaWtM19TX5S9iA,"I took my friend to dinner for her birthday. She had three different tacos and I tried the Huarache (which I'd never had before). One word...DELICIOUS!!!!  I couldn't decide between the green or red sauce so they suggested I have half and half. When I order this again sometime soon, I will definitely go with the green sauce. My friend loved her tacos too. The restaurant is very clean and the wait staff is very friendly and helpful. Food was hot and fresh!  I love the pottery plates too; they are beautiful and the food stays hot on them!!  I can't wait to go back again!",hBPaEn1KZLjX8DEiKvQNgw,2021-12-07 02:02:55,jqnl080wAOhOhyCMrYddhw,5,Britt
