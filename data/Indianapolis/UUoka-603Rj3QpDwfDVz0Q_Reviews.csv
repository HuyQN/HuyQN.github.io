S5v_HPctWeenIPEh_v9hJg,"I left a review over at Sun King Brewery because I thought they were the ones that cooked those awful burgers. They let me kid that this restaurant cooked them... So as I was saying the burgers were so burnt, I could hardly choke it down!!! Thank goodness that had this dandy sauce that tasted like egg salad. I had to smear that on the sandwich and ketchup too just to eat it!!! BTW a much better option would be the chicken and waffles!!! I left the restaurant so jealous of my friend for getting that. I don't believe in taking my food back because I don't want anyone doing something to my food, but the burger was so bad, I had to ask the host if all the burgers was like that and she said yes!!! Waste of a Good gift card",aIJslrRidBDODBy-2kxQLA,2021-06-29 06:10:39,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,3,Lola
d2v94XUwbOgOVps3VE6qlA,"I rode my bike over to the Broad Ripple Sun King to claim my burger & beer reward at One Trick Pony. The location is great, close to the monon (for me, it was before having to cross at Broad Ripple Ave, which is great) and if driving, there's a large parking lot. The menu isn't huge, burgers, fries, onion rings with brunch options on the weekend. I went with the basic dinner style with cheese fries. Our server recommended a double vs the single because they're prepared smashed. Initially I had that ""...what are you implying?!"" moment in my head but she was right. For an average adult or smaller person who skipped breakfast and biked in, a double has a good meat/bun/toppings ratio. I'm glad I took her suggestion. I couldn't resist the cheese fries because...beer cheese. It was all what I was wanting, down to the crispy beef bits that fell off the edges of my burger. The meat had a lovely crispy outer edge but wasn't dried out. The patty wasn't super seasoned which isn't an issue for me when it has lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, mustard, ketchup and mayo on it. I also appreciated that all of the toppings were balanced and not overdone-no mouthful of mustard or pile if excess onion over here! The cheese fries were tasty as well. I slacked on the fries and the cheese congealed a bit on top but it wasn't bad enough for me to leave them.And Sun King beer & drinks! This is a good spot for some people watching on their front patio-this is at street level facing traffic, so don't hope for quiet conversation-and a casual burger and beer.",evacYtS7KvF1U8nhko8ECw,2021-06-09 12:09:43,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,4,Lien
GC1SubNLuLLKNdFZTlAi4Q,The oat burger is awful. Please allow those of us who don't eat beef (park) another alternative. The impossible burger I had a handful of months ago was great! Bring something like this back? Called from your bar after I paid for this to grab take out from 317 burger.,stZRPqVJoVCstDhH8JipSQ,2021-08-29 22:03:13,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,1,Jennifer
48ZWVRnlNVg0ntqWLVWs-Q,"Wow! I really liked this burger. It's absolutely genius to be hyper focused on one thing and doing it well. I really enjoyed the space. Tons of space, some great music, and my favorite brewery. Grabbed a pitcher of Pachanga, and a double burger. I will definitely be back.",FzE1BQpHoATeI0cxj-V2Gw,2021-11-02 11:52:50,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,5,Kaleem
KaGJe18nhk79ZiX6Hk8DeA,Seriously awesome burgers and onion rings that hit the spot every time consistently. Fast service.,MffIgW7QI_1JiYNse4CEwQ,2021-07-25 16:45:48,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,5,Chris
fpZfu-qQkJlkKgC5Mr97PQ,Everything you would hope for and expect out of a classic smash burger. I got the single dandy and my husband got the double dandy. We were both so happy with our meal. We also split a large onion ring order which was also bomb. Sun king staff were awesome and quick at the bar. The menu is small but has everything you need. We will definitely be back.,BewDV2ISn0uAMLcsyrhiZg,2021-10-10 07:05:11,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,5,Karley
a-Q86hJ8hqm6KQFsOqTbDw,"This burger spot is located within Sun King Brewery in Broad Ripple. They have a ton of big tables for groups, a bar, and excellent service (you order at the table). I absolutely LOVE that one of Indy's top breweries brought in this amazing burger biz to serve up the food. Top Indy chef Neal Brown made this delicious burger concept and his skill, paired with the specialty menu, makes you confident that anything you order will be incredible. I ordered the ""Old John"" Diner-Style Burger with a single patty. It comes with American cheese, shredduce, onion, tomato, pickle, mayo, and mustard. The cheese is crispy on the ends to add some crunch and the bun was great too. I absolutely loved it. My friends ordered the cheese fries and the oui oui fries, so I of course snagged a few. Those were great as well. So good!!! I'll be back!",WwulXySQN8t2hwqH_yWurA,2021-10-11 13:57:36,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,5,Niki
xGdCO_fIAOP0S4_AlDalzg,"I'm not going to lie, I didn't have high expectations for this place. My fiancé is the burger lover and has been dying to check this out. It's located in Sun King at the end of the Broad Ripple strip and we live nearby so we finally went. I have to say, WOW I was pleasantly surprised. They are correct that they are a one trick pony but they do it so so well. I got the Old John burger because I wanted something regular. The fries were so crispy and tasty. Next time I go, I will get the Oklahoma Onion Burger. Perfect lunch date.",-7GAQ7ZeBF7zeTc3-XSSbw,2021-11-02 16:23:56,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,5,Samantha
WqvVictUaIN1vIRM9eBsYg,"I came here as part of Burger Week. I imagine if you are local and love beer, you've been here. My friends tell me Sun King beer is great.Regards service, they needed another two or three servers. I waited 23 minutes before a server appeared. (I know this because Google told me.) I know they are probably desperate for servers like a lot of restaurants.I asked for the Burger Week special but removed items. The first and second burgers both included items I removed. When my server brought the second burger she left the first one, clearly annoyed with me. I'll admit I just got the burger. But the key to good service is treating everyone the same regardless of how much they spend.",1Uy4jZvuCJ1UVWKryo9IRw,2021-06-23 01:22:24,UUoka-603Rj3QpDwfDVz0Q,2,Zackary
