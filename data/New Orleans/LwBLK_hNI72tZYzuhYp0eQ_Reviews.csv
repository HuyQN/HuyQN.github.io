R6XSEEhvNp_h7cplwW_b0g,"Being a brand new restaurant it was a little rough around the edges, but overall a good dinner experience.  The Peking Duck Sampler were two small bun sandwiches but very flavorful.  The steamed dumplings were tasty, and the Mongolian Beef was a little oily but very robust.    For dessert the Mango with Sticky Rice was nicely smooth and sweet without excess sugar.  Staff was friendly and attentive.",nkAjT-VtTr5jKhI_2xMX7w,2021-08-18 23:54:01,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,4,Charles
2ifTGYavUtzRVxajCcOpSg,"First off, I'm really happy to have another Chinese restaurant in the French Quarter. And, based on what I witnessed this weekend, Zhang is off to a very busy and successful start. I'm glad!This review is based off my experience with take out. I haven't eaten at the restaurant, although the design and decor of the physical space are really appealing. They did a good job revamping the space, which used to be grungy. During a busy weekend dinner, the restaurant was very busy. There were a LOT of families and kids, which is not something I'm looking for in a dining experience. My takeout order was also 15 minutes late, which is not a huge deal--especially for a new business. They're still working out the kinks. Onto the food. None of the food was bad. My main gripe is that the items I ordered did not match their descriptions on the menu. I ordered vegetable fried rice. However, it didn't come with any vegetables. It did come with tofu, which I did not order. I will say that their tofu is outstanding--much, much better than the tofu I've had at other local Chinese or Thai restaurants. So I wasn't mad about that, but I really missed the vegetables. When ordering (and paying for) vegetables in a dish like fried rice, that means things like broccoli, baby corn, etc. This dish didn't have anything like that. Only tofu. So, while it was basically tasty, that's not something I would have ordered had the description been accurate. I also got medium heat (out of three heat options), and it was not spicy. So, if you're really into heat, I would go with ""hot."" I also got the egg drop soup, which was delicious--easily the best item I ordered. However, the menu says it has peas, carrots, and mushroom. It didn't have any of these things. It's important that menu items are accurate and that the kitchen is in communication with front of house on this sort of thing. This might all fall under the ""working out the kinks"" umbrella. I also tried the ""spicy"" cucumber salad, though it was not spicy at all. It was more of a sweet, soy-based sauce. It was fine. The veggie egg rolls were standard, in the Thai style. For a to go order, the presentation was nice. The egg rolls had a slice of lemon and an attractive sprig of mint. I appreciated the presentation. I imagine the presentation in the restaurant must be very nice. I'll definitely be back in a few weeks to try other dishes and see how things have progressed. Overall, a very welcome addition to the French Quarter.",3Q0fciqaAXBPf1HJg8K2Qw,2021-07-05 16:21:02,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,3,Jeremy

EjyIfIQA5v8fvG893BPpyA,"We stopped in for dinner before hitting up a music event. We had no real plans in terms of where we were going to stop but as we were walking by the place looked nice and we were intrigued by their drink specials on the board. We sat at the bar and our bartender was very nice. He politely explained the drinks we weren't familiar with. I was torn between my two favorites- red curry and kung pao and he also talked me through how they make theirs so I could make a decision. I went with kung pao and they had a really pretty presentation. I was also happy with the amount of chicken, peanuts and zucchini. Only slight downside was the amount of rice it comes with. I don't usually eat the rice but the dish is big enough to share or have leftovers but if you like rice you'd need a second serving.  All-in-all would totally go back to try more items from their menu!",2FThL9VtdO9lsaThpzi4wQ,2021-10-30 14:01:10,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,4,Meghan

SwcZengZaX5_DkxcfBdGWA,"The French Quarter is quite overwhelming with all the theatrics, the people, the many storefronts so this place may blend in with the drama. They are a fusion restaurant combining Thai & Chinese cuisine under one roof. The place is great for large group dinners since the portions of the entrees are huge! Their appetizers were probably the highlight of our meal. We got their Shu Mai, Spicy Cucumbers, Fried Dumplings, Shrimp Wontons, Salt & Pepper Shrimp,  Spicy Fried Chick, Drunken Noodles, & Bok Choy. Make sure you are prepared for the spice level, the Fried Chicken is numbing!@phidingthefam",C29mwZb95W3BDDaz2apFUg,2021-10-09 18:19:27,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,4,Vince

We were seated immediately and our drink orders were taken. My partner got a local beer and it was made from grapefruit. I don't drink (some people become ""too wonderful for words"" after a few, lol) but it smelled great. Our hot and sour soup was delicious and hot! (as in temperature, not spice). We ordered vegetarian pad thai, garlic eggplant, curry chicken, and a couple items to go. Each entree was delicious, hot, and our server was great! The bartender was friendly although his mask was a tad bit intimidating (S & M spikes) and all in good fun!

tTZde-CsGgb2bGWm11ssdw,"Happened upon this place after a walking tour in the city left as at America Sports Saloon across the street and it totally salvaged an otherwise wash of a night.Immediately greeted when entering (which I love) and was given the choice of bar or table seating. Sat at the bar and had the most pleasant experience when James who was very accommodating of my husbands dietary restrictions. Our food came out very quickly. David also helped get us settled.The Peking duck app was great, a little fatty but that can be expected. The coconut shrimp as a rec from James was great. Nice and crispy and not too heavily seasoned.Then I got Mongolian beef- loved! Perfect amount of food and the sauce was fantastic. Came with rice and got a combo of shrimp beef and chicken fried rice that was also great.My husband got pad Thai and all the toppings came on the side so you could add more or have less of the peanuts and red chili or scallions.The baby bok choy we got on the side also came with rice so hit it with the combo again. Really nice clean flavor not overly soy sauced. Garlic chunk which I love.The portions for the money were great, took leftovers home and had them the next day and even reheated were spot on.Happy to have gotten to find this place and speak with James and David for our meal.

iCc1JFsAKgJg72x5XBuPXw,My rating is based on my experience after numerous visits (dine in and to go) which all of them have been extremely pleasurable. My entrees primarily have been from their Signature and Thai selections of the menu with a few ventures to the Chinese side. I always choose the medium spice level and it's definitely the hottest I would personally be able to handle. It's a 4 out of 5 handkerchief rating for the sinus opening level! I would order everyone of the dishes I've had so far again which is very rare for me to say about a restaurant. They have all been large portions-either large enough for two to share or lunch the next day-and reasonably priced. The duck appetizer and fresh rolls so far are my favorite appetizers but I haven't tried them all so time will tell. I love their PadThai and Red curry sauce and well the roti is another must if you enjoy a bread with your meal. The waitstaff are all extremely pleasant and attentive. They also offer Apple Pay which is a huge plus in my book.  The atmosphere is nice and spacious which helps with the covid protocols. They offer a large bar which is perfect when dining alone.,kKuN_D2Z81TaXutP1hScDg,2021-10-05 23:41:27,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,5,Darla

3WsU0wKIEKt5kInU4kh6tA,"Although I'm only giving this review three stars, I'll start off by saying that the place is really not bad, at all. We sat at the bar and had some happy hour drinks (the Bali Lemon Freeze is delicious). The food is decent. BUT (and thus the rating) there is literally no spice to anything at all. We like extremely spicy  Thai and Szechuan food, and that's what we thought we were getting - not the case. We asked for ALL our dishes to be ""Thai hot"" (the hottest) and not a single dish was even mildly spicy, sadly. The Spicy Cucumber salad is not spicy. More of a soy flavor. Crispy egg rolls were crispy egg rolls. Good, but nothing spectacular.The peking duck sampler was actually pretty tasty. The biggest disappointment was the dry red chili chicken. At a real Szechuan place, this would be numbing from the peppercorns and chilis, and pretty spicy. This one was neither numbing nor spicy, and was not really that great. Mapo Tofu was good, and a decent amount of food, just not spicy in the least. Thai Basil (beef) was tasty, but again just lacking all spice you'd want. If you come in looking for pretty mild Chinese or Thai food, you'll probably be OK, but be sure to know what you're getting.",6BPMK69rK1UPhcVi_B-q2w,2021-12-25 19:02:10,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,3,Dave

We looked over the menu and decided to order a cross section of items so we could try different foods. We started with the cucumber salad, the coconut shrimp and the steamed dumplings. The cucumber salad was flavor-free. The coconut shrimp appetizer was delicious and the steamed dumplings were just okay. For entree's, we ordered the red chili chicken and the beef lo mien. The red chili chicken was THE MOST SPICY DISH I HAVE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE. I love spice, but this was ridiculous. I took 1 bite and could not go any further. My husband tried to get past 2 bites, but could not. We called the waiter over to inquire if it was supposed to be THAT hot and he shrugged and said, ""it is spicy."" I told him we were not going to be able to eat it and he just looked at me. He did not offer to replace it with anything else.

Family owned, you may be shocked to discover that the bus people and table cleaners are actually the owners, who pitch in as needed all over the restaurant.

1-GNStuR2b8Wl_F0U8SOQg,"Welcome to New Orleans Zhang Bistro.  In a city full of spectacular Asian food, this place on their soft opening is special.  They offer a combination of traditional Thai AND Chinese dishes.  The ingredients are so fresh, and the liberal use of Thai basil is warmly welcomed. I like my food generally very spicy.  They offer three options and today I went medium just to set a baseline.   It was really balanced, just enough heat, but not enough to make you sweat.   All the spices were to enhance the ingredients, not overpower them.   We had several dishes and would happily order any of them again.   Of everything we ordered the chicken coconut soup was probably my favorite. Sweet, savory, crisp.... Perfect hot day bowl of soup, and it was 89 today.  So glad this joint opened, it replaced some spectacularly bad restaurants that have inhabited the space over the years.",4IzHh2Cfoddv3ZXZqqtZzA,2021-06-26 00:00:47,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,5,Michael

The bartender/hostess was super friendly and seated us immediately in the fairly quiet dining room. Very comfortable, casual atmosphere.  Our server took great care of us from start to finish.  We started with a couple cold beers and their version of Tom Kha (coconut chicken) soup, which was very good but a bit more watery than I'm used to.  Went with the spring rolls with peanut sauce next, which were awesome.  For entrees we had cashew chicken stir fry, General Tso chicken, sweet & sour chicken and walnut shrimp.  All were solid choices, however I found medium spice level to be very mild and the walnut shrimp to be a bit on the sweet side.  Definitely going to crank the spice level up a notch next time and will likely try one of the curry dishes. ZB is a nice addition to the lower Decatur dining scene!",SbpGncVoxFIi_J2xOelJYQ,2021-09-23 02:20:19,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,4,Greg

I'm disappointed they aren't checking for masks or vax cards. I'll give this place another try post-Covid when I feel a bit safer in their space.",D-P92irH-MDyq7OYBxWreA,2021-10-14 04:35:09,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,3,Spud

I love Dian Xin due to their dining area size, it is such a hassle to get a table... but Zhang Bistro is huge and even though you do not have a reservation it is pretty easy to get a table when you walk in! We came here for a dinner on the weekend and it was very busy yet I did not feel like the service was slow. We were seated pretty quickly and everything was pretty much flowing smoothly. Our order came out pretty quickly and they came out in order. Did not have any complaints regarding food item as they came out as we expected! Can't wait to come back!",4Mw__5UeTEW5L1B7nriYqw,2021-12-20 22:39:50,LwBLK_hNI72tZYzuhYp0eQ,5,Jiwon
