13E59hhKVicSjr2TomYbYA,"We were so sad that Rye and pie closed but the owners did not disappoint in revamping the restaurant to become La Lucha! We definitely needed a taco place on this side of downtown. We ordered the steak, chicken, shrimp and cactus. All were flavorful and filling. The verde salsa it comes with in the side has a nice kick. Each taco was $5 so a pretty good deal. I also got a margarita that was a nice size for $10. As a California native I've had a lot of tacos and I'll be back again! We ordered at the window and had our tacos in no time! It was also a bit chilly and the owner turned on the heaters so even though it's all outdoor the ambiance is so nice.",ZmmtRCpHrOy0of1s8enW4g,2021-11-29 00:27:28,kuQ-hmZHQa2VXeFyJwew5A,5,Liz
4-svluj_2mLFRK32nrLtXw,This little gem of a place opened a few weeks ago in the Warehouse District across from Cochon. They have a big outdoor patio with good music and candles on the tables. You order at the counter and the food comes out to your table quick and hot. We had really good chips and dips and authentic street tacos on excellent tortillas. The chicken tinga and steak were our favorites. The Milagro tamarind margarita with tajin rim was delicious. This is a nice addition to the neighborhood and a great place for outdoor dining.,EqwPOfsuxp_xuexwHK5P1g,2021-12-11 01:05:14,kuQ-hmZHQa2VXeFyJwew5A,5,Shane
xAxy946E5tp0y8EJB2g1yA,"This place has great outdoor dining with awesome drinks and tacos! We got the pineapple Serrano margarita and the steak, chicken tinga, and pork tacos - all were very good! We also got the chips and guac which was great. They have a nice outdoor tv to watch the football game and some Latin music playing for entertainment.",j--lSa8kI2szZRUzlyimHw,2021-12-28 02:55:11,kuQ-hmZHQa2VXeFyJwew5A,5,Monya
