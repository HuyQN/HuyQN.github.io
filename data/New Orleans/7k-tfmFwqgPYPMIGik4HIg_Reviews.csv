o-hjfVjyb9LLQkDc_yUQEg,"I had a good time here. Burger was tasty though I didn't like the flavor of the crispy onions. The cabbage and carrot salad that accompanied the burger was bland. I thought it'd be more of a cole slaw but it wasn't. The Modern Mule drink I had was really tasty. I'd definitely get that again. The patio is pretty spacious, although I only went out there to take pics. They're a new place and so far they show a lot of promise. Definitely give them a try",w7bsKprO-7ROYkWYczlDOQ,2021-08-02 01:04:20,7k-tfmFwqgPYPMIGik4HIg,4,Shalon
dMpkTxi9XlZCIIVzLjCg4A,"New Bar alert! Cute and newly renovated space, the set up is great for football season. Enjoyed the service and the staff were great. The patio is huge and can't wait to see what kind of events they'll host back there. Didn't get a chance to try the food but the items on the menu look delicious to try. There is a full bar and variety of frozen drinks to try, the froze was superb. I see this becoming a staple spot to go to during the weekends.",xwJVljoFYy-CaVg46rTjfw,2021-06-22 00:04:47,7k-tfmFwqgPYPMIGik4HIg,5,Andres

RxTVPfDMPOPhXWQOBpfAqA,"I attended a private event at The American Townhouse this weekend and it was one of the best experiences I have had in a long long time.  The bartenders made sure an empty drink glass was not to be, the horderves and dinner that The American Townhouse provided was excellent and the venue is just outstanding.  If anyone is looking for a place for a private party or just and an after drink, I recommend The American Townhouse.",iR2vaS-V79H7WIaLtybW4w,2021-11-21 21:11:47,7k-tfmFwqgPYPMIGik4HIg,5,Allen
Zgk5BqJQm__tBiwO0A-WPQ,"I attended a private party over the weekend at AT.  The venue is new and fresh, everything was spotless, the food and service were outstanding.  Restrooms are cool (private unisex) and the courtyard is spacious and inviting.  I have to compliment the staff on their attention to detail, they made sure everyone had a full drink at all times, and the delicious food just kept on rolling out of the kitchen.  I look forward to returning as a patron and checking out the day-to-day version of American Townhouse.  Check it out!",Ck9iyrjS3Up1c5P1VEOCgQ,2021-11-24 00:42:54,7k-tfmFwqgPYPMIGik4HIg,5,Bill
oso_5TEyyA0dDW_URMU_Ig,"Really enjoyed my few visits here and really want this place to thrive! Not only do they have amazing drink prices but they have some solid food choices as well. Recently opened, American Townhouse is a large space and has plenty of seating for everyone. There's a beautiful wrap around bar for you to make a new friend or spend time with your group. Plenty of bar tables alongside the wall and they even have an outdoor patio.You order food in the back room at the order window and they'll bring it out to you. Those fries are delicious!!Love how they have gender neutral bathrooms.Open To All, LGBTQ+ Bar",2jCrH48LDG4c3ja4CLh0qg,2021-08-27 20:03:09,7k-tfmFwqgPYPMIGik4HIg,5,Tomas
