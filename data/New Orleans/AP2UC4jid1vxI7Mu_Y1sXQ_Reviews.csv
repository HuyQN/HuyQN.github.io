svut8ftY2CDolQMc_7EUvQ,"Stop what you're doing. Put on shoes. And no matter your mode of transportation (walk, drive, bike, Falkor, etc) head to Bywater American Bistro and order yourself some of the most creative and mouthwatering food New Orleans has to offer! The dishes offered at this neighborhood brew pub are heralded as Viet-Cajun, and we loved all of it!We started our meal off with the cheesy egg rolls, and knew we were in for quite a treat. The outside was a perfectly crisped egg roll wrapper that crunched with each bite. Inside had mounds of oozing, gooey cheese. They were like mozzarella sticks with even more flavor than normal. For our meal we shared the  Phorrito, which had Sliced Roast Beef, rice noodles, onions, scallions, thai basil, bean sprouts, cilantro, sriracha, hoisin wrapped in a hot flour tortilla with a side of pho broth gravy for dips, and the Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos. The Vietnamese Crawfish Etouffee Nachos has so many words in the title and even more flavors to enjoy! Fried wonton chips, chedder & cojita cheese, scallions, cilantro made for the perfect pairing for each of the beers we tried.As for the beer selection, it was very impressive. We tried a few as it was happy hour pricing (bonus!) While they had many selections you'd expect, we really liked their Vienna lager spiked with New Orleans Chicory coffee because it felt like something you could only get in the Big Easy. It was almost as bold as the Deb Does Chocolate - Chocolate Stout which featured mammoth amounts of flavor. We loved our experience so much that each night during our visit we contemplated eating at Bywater Brew Pub a second (or even third) time! The customer service was stellar too. Our waiter was so chill and friendly that I wanted to be their friend. This added to the overall dope vibe of their venue, which was very welcoming and gave off the feel of a neighborhood chill zone!",Glq_5Fn45I4HkNqRhfuDkw,2021-06-16 21:25:41,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Jason
Z_5lEpaQYd161yBRvFWyIA,"The hours on this place are weird. What kind of liquor establishment closes at 9? But a lot of the NOLA restaurants have weird hours. My vegetarian traveling companion was recommended this place so that's why we made it a point to try out. Service was speedy and the ambience was neat. There was live music there, though the performer did come off a bit pushy, going to each table with a bucker asking folks if they'd like to donate to the ""performer"" (which was her). Now, as I was NOT the vegetarian at the table, I got the Vietnamese BBQ shrimp. The waiter warned me that I'd have to peel the shrimp so it'd be a bit of ""work"". As an avid seafood-lover, I was not deterred. It was DELICIOUS. These shrimp were jumbo-sized with the heads still on, but cooked to perfection so they popped off easily after shelling. They rested atop the buttermilk biscuit all sitting in a savory broth that had me licking my fingers and smacking my lips. I love Vietnamese cuisine, but this place added the New Orleans twist I came to this city for. Definitely worth a stop here.Oh, and they do fries RIGHT. I noticed this about a lot of restaurants in New Orleans. This city is good at fries.",1XboxYVq73bvQaeEcuNL9Q,2021-12-01 03:24:02,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,4,Quandra

8PjbZTvmNpR0GUj3150QKw,"Checked out a new spot that opened during covid and it was great! We made a reservation although I don't think it's required. Beautiful, spacious dining area and bar with bright colors and tons of local art. It was so exciting to go somewhere new and feel so safe! Service was friendly with great personal recommendations. The cheesy egg rolls and spring rolls were great. Lots of texture and flavor complimented the local brews we ordered. Our entrees, delivered quickly, hit the spot! The Bahn Mi burger was packed with flavor and texture and cooked wonderfully! I was happy to learn that cilantro could be eliminated and many of the meat-centric apps and sides could be prepared for vegetarian diners! Vietnamese and Cajun cuisine is a perfect fusion. GO. DINE.

zddZ0jF8vUeGyg3LxPsCGw,"Omgeeee Yes!! This place rocks! First off, I used to walk by this place with my Dog and the workers are always giving her their homemade dog treats! Their kindness and the overall good vibes of this place had me wanting to try it out. Today I tried it out and it was amazing! First of all the servers were so kind and really good at their jobs. It's very spacious, they have these cool garage style doors that they have open which creates a lovely airy open space, they have bar seating, and they also offer outdoor seating. The drinks were strong, I had the Ginger Jalapeño Mescalrita, my mom had a Mai Tai. The food was delicious super fresh and oh so good. I had the Tofu Burger which had a really good garlic soy aioli and cheese grits! You can get the tofu grilled or fried I had the fried version, the brioche bun was fresh and delicious. My mom had the Grilled lemongrass pork belly lettuce wraps. We both loved our food and the service! The owner was there and he walked to every table to introduce himself and ask us all how we were enjoying our experience. The prices are fair, the food is delicious and the drinks are strong! I highly recommend this place. Also they have a Happy hour everyday from 4-6!! Got to there! Enjoy",7_p0lTZcuO5dUp75bJPQow,2021-03-13 21:33:51,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Nicki
e_dCXNvseC1g2tisM0RNYQ,"One of my new years resolutions always seems to be to write more reviews, but I haven't gone much anywhere in 2021 yet! So happy I finally made it to Bywater Brewpub! Really just wanted a snack and try the beer but then wanted EVERYTHING on the menu. My partner and I got the margarita and Slip-n-fall golden ale, with the pork rillettes and cheesy egg rolls (with sweet chili remoulade waaaat?! So good). Then the phoritto (pho ingredients wrapped up like a burrito, if that isn't obvious). It came with a dipping sauce, and I was like no way is that a reduced pho broth, that would be too perfect, and it waaaas. Inhaled it all. Also got the Ahn Luu gives you wings. Whole wings (menu said 3, but came with 4) covered in a traditional Vietnamese sweet/salty sauce with buku herbs, and side of rice noodles to soak up all that good good. ALSO everything came out lightning fast and hot. You could tell nothing was just sitting under a heat lamp. Our waitress was so cute and funny, and checked on us the perfect amount of times. THEN after our bill was paid, she came out with a free slice of king cake! It was devine, covered in a frosting with a hint of lime that was so unique. COVID Test: Tables were spaced out more than 6 feet, and we sat by huge garage type doors for good air circulation. No staff had lose masks or their noses out. Can't wait to go back and try more menu items! Clap clap clap!!",8feTLqtm5Wzri4g9KlC-rQ,2021-02-07 02:47:14,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Robert
GQpGgmuudVXYCHrgbcATAg,We are here from out of town. We were looking for something less tourist-y and more of a local vibe. Found this place on a random social media post and saw Vietnamese/Cajun mix of food and went for it. Service 5/5 When arriving we were greeted promptly and told to pick a seat. Our server was the person that seated us and she began serving us immediately. She told us to call her Baby D we think!(it was hard to hear through the masks lol). She was an absolute beast of a waitress. Couldn't have asked for a single thing more from her. Also she was cool as hell. Environment 5/5 They were playing great music over the speakers. Had local artists on the walls and the place was spotless. Very hip and a great place to kick back and hang out with friends. Food 5/5 We had the Vietnamese Crawfish Étouffée Nachos(our favorite item of the night) and when I say they were amazing.... we almost ate the paper. For our entree we had the Yaka Mein with an order of Cheesy Egg Rolls. Also great tasting. Drinks 5/5 they had a good variety of craft beers on tap and all the ones we tried were tasty. Unfortunately they weren't able to serve their own beers yet due to complications from COVID. But the beers they did have were sourced locally. The cocktails we had were also good especially their spin on an Irish Coffee. Long review but they don't have a lot so I figured I'd give everyone a comprehensive review. Definitely give this place a shot especially if you are a local. They deserve your business. The chef and owner both stopped by the table and said a hello and thank you. Seems like an upstanding business ran by people who really care.,NBq2DVP91oV1exzHJ-Ry2w,2021-01-02 07:19:46,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Tanner
XpAYhr9JZWlv1PMU50ychA,"Anh is a seasoned chef who is always on the cutting edge of magical food creations. I love how she marries different flavors - creating untraditional yet tasty dishes. It's hard to pick my favorite, but the Viet-Cajun Crawfish ans the Yaka Main were incredible. The service is impeccable and vibes are awesome. I highly recommend anyone to hit up Bywater Brew Pub!",kYeTPjNv3iT1XNJMskHxvw,2021-06-05 06:15:36,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Rosa
GUGjxKgbaOmsZkx-X1cFUg,Can't recommend this place enough!  Happened upon this one random Friday.  Met the owner Nahum.  So kind and shared the story of this new place .  So cool!!  The flight was fantastic.  Haven't tried the food yet but we will on our next trip,t3Ybycyle-Io22y3Q0wqfw,2021-01-29 21:00:04,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Linda
5QzZZjnlwJhGmZcJwv-OnA,"I have to say I was pleasantly surprised with this new little gem in the Bywater area! They are a current partner with JAMNOLA and we discovered through their to-go program they offer one free beer with your meal when you show your to-go cup and ticket from that day.I have to yell from the get go how badass it is that Bywater Brewpub has gender neutral stalls and bathrooms for both bathrooms. Probably the only place in New Orleans I've yet to see this at.Anyways back to the beer, especially their own beers, because they were F-I-R-E! I loved their Slip-N-Fall and Better Daze Ahead. Order a few of them! They also sell other beers and a beer flight.Food is fusion based as it's a blend of Cajun and Vietnamese cuisine and flavors. Your table is served chopsticks and utensils.Started off with their Pickles & Pig plate and Cheesy Egg Rolls as apps for the table.Pickles & Pig is pickled vegetables and crispy cracklin bites. It's actually fried char siu pork so it was a great nibble. Easily can be shared between 3-4 people.The Cheesy Egg Rolls were delicious and perfect for any cheese lover. Think of these as airy mozzarella sticks. My only bit is that you'll need to order two of these as they only come in three's.Opted for the Fried Chicken Sandwich and this is not any regular chicken sandwich! It was a unique breading method as the chicken is done karaage style. Light and fluffy. I really should've ordered a second one. Came with a side of phottuccini and it was a unique take on mac n cheese.",2jCrH48LDG4c3ja4CLh0qg,2021-02-16 17:53:38,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Tomas
BQsoWxsqcO9cEoTn5KUpvg,Crawfish Etoufee nachos are the best nachos I have ever had.  The Louisiana/Asian food is finger licking good.  The beer is excellent with many choices.  Margaritas were generous and strong.  The fried rice is to die for.  Come by now!  The beignet bites are the best way to end a meal.,oUX3mxE80m-jI9Hl85cbPw,2021-05-23 00:03:49,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Diane

0TaFqeHqIKaj44_sSUuZ5Q,"Dinner was wonderful! Our server, Nora, was nice, attentive and spot-on with her recommendations. I asked her what her favorite dishes were, and she of course, said that everything is great, but she particularly liked ""The Phoritto"" and the ""Cajun Fried Rice"". Both descriptions sounded good, so we got them both and shared. Both were so different and so tasty. They were both so good that I can't even tell you which one I liked better. The Phoritto had a ""pho broth gravy"" for dipping that had a spicy zip to it. The Cajun Fried Rice was a great combination of so many different flavors; I liked every single part of it, but I think the sausage might've been my favorite part.We didn't really need any more food, but the Beer Beignet Bites sounded so awesome that we decided to go for it. The chef brought them out to us herself, and they were so hot and fresh and delicious! They're served with a chicory coffee dip, and OMG was that ever good! And they really are teeny little beignets, with each one being bite-sized, so it was just the right amount of indulgence.The owner was making the rounds to all of the tables to see if we were enjoying everything. It's always nice to know that someone truly cares about your experience. In fact, it was apparent that every employee was very invested in making it a great experience for the customers. They really take pride in what they're doing, and they have every right to be proud! They're working on brewing their own beer too -- coming soon!",D6oTX3XdX3HqtXLT1PK-7w,2020-12-20 22:56:27,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Janell
5PML7Kdq6a5mGQy7aiBekg,"They have a pretty cool environment & menu selection. I really enjoyed the crawfish etouffe nachos with the wonton chips! But you have to eat them relatively quickly or the chips get soggy. The burger was decent, but i really enjoyed the bun it was on. Good beer selection, but I got the cider & like that as well. My only complaint: the cheese grits were probably the worst I've ever had. I would not recommend ordering them. The rest of the food made up for it though",eta4SV6ULkxmeBFGjmMe4A,2021-01-26 23:30:23,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,4,Kamber

I have no idea what used to be here, but the space is so welcoming and charming, very open with plenty of outdoor seating also. Super cool local art all over the walls. We came for the crawfish, which did not disappoint! Just the right level of spice, and the edamame was a unique twist. I also tried the grilled veggie spring rolls which were a delicious healthy option and a generous portion. We did a beer flight and enjoyed all 4 of them.

We are IPA folks and enjoyed the Hoppy Daze so much we stayed for a while on a lovely Friday afternoon.  Since we were too full from brunch, we only had a snack, spring rolls with shrimp.

KbsL8IVGAYD2UrqMnZcbYg,This place was awesome.  Really spacious with cool artwork and a huge screen which came down for football. The beers were delicious- we got four different ones and everyone was happy with their selection. The food was also tasty with vegetarian options.  The Brussels sprouts and etouiffe nachos were awesome appetizers.  The phorritos were unique and tasty. The short rib special and total with cheese also a hit with our group.  We finished with the bite sized beignets which were perfect.  Off the beaten path and worth the trip!,6Vb-e-0IFceCNd5Z3kMEJw,2021-11-08 00:20:35,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Sharon

Whp9orsmScJCCrxxYrvKCw,"They are here and hopefully to stay. It is my first time here. I am so impressed with the variety of beers they brew. They haven't sold out to the IPA nightmare that soMany other companies have they have one IPA on this visit , I hope  they don't go past more than  2 IPA's at one time. I had the urban south a delightful sour with cucumber and lime very summery beer. The queen of the south was a nutty red ale I enjoyed that also, the 3 in my flight was the blackberry Hefeweizen which had a even measured bitter sweet with a berry finish. The food was a star for me this time the flight and bite had a great little bites with each beer and just enough to snack and I still could eat my most flavorful bite of 2021 for sure, maybe if all time, let me introduce you to ""PHoritto""- pho soup flavors in a burrito with the noodles, hoisin, Thai basil and the pho gravy for dipping, I just poured it on the container was a little small to dip. The flavors were wonderfully matched that if a deconstructed bowl of Pho. Thanks to the Chef. Great service,location and nice staff. I also like the feeling of the place and decorations. I will be back to try the IPA and any other creations they come up with.

szR_WFDmBYM4Jevx13a7gQ,"Long awaited brew pub was worth the wait!!  They don't have their own brews on tap yet, but soon.  They're featuring beers from local breweries (at least 10 right now, so plenty to choose from) and a fantastic kitchen of Cajun/Vietnamese fusion food.  We loved the menu so much, we totally over ordered:Yaka mein: Enough for two and they'll split the bowl for you at no charge.  Not too salty, lots of beef and yummy noodles.  ""Old sober"" fills you up and warms your tummy.Pickles & pigs: Hands down the best cracklins I've ever had, ever.The Phoritto: Had to take it home because we ordered too much food and were stuffed.  Warmed up well.  Fresh tortilla and all the ingredients from a beef pho. Came with a roux-style pho dippin' sauce - heaven! Spring rolls: Fresh delicious huge rolls of happiness. The secret ingredient (apple) makes these stand out. In addition to the fantastic food, the service was impeccable.  The ambiance has a ""we've been here forever and we care about our restaurant"" feel, even though they've just opened.  Big roll up doors to add some fresh air, lots of seating, unisex bathrooms, and some TVs if you want to catch the game.  Looks like they have tours of the brewery space too.",vlx1Vn0txmphKLtpK3L52w,2021-01-05 18:11:30,AP2UC4jid1vxI7Mu_Y1sXQ,5,Emily

I was skeptical that it would work but the wonton nachos were the perfect compliment to the etouffee topping. So good!!! We also split the burger and you can tell they make their own bread.
