OuRmo6XZ4qONJQ5OiMvxNA,"Okay, I was very skeptical of this place - it seemed a little too trendy on the outside. But let me tell you, we LOVED it. For me personally, it didn't feel like a watered down version of Vietnamese food which is what I kinda expected. Overall the flavors were great and the food was delicious - I'll definitely be returning. We started off with the steamed rice rolls which were TO DIE FOR. For real, I could eat a whole plate of these myself. Everything about this dish was delicious and the shrimp were soooo fresh. For a main I decided to get the Banh Cuon which was very similar to the rice roll we got as an appetizer. It was delicious but I preferred the sauce with the appetizer more. My partner got the Dan Dan which was overall good but the broth lacked some flavor - needed more salt for sure, though overall not bad. Their beignets taste straight up like toaster strudels which I enjoyed, haha! Service was also so sweet and quick even tho they were packed. I'm excited to come back for their happy hour and try some new things!",NbyICxQ51Kan_JtlkmOffg,2021-10-25 18:11:38,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Monique

Fantastic food, fantastic service, fantastic cocktails, fantastic wine, cool outdoor vibe. Everything is good. All is good. God is great.",MD1yODdvSWp1fHQJu7wn2w,2021-12-24 23:48:34,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Jay
9bkakHolPOkTI-KV1Tr_nA,The food was delicious.  BEWARE they charge for every soda refill. The menu did NOT state that information. The waitress did not share as I ordered a 2nd and third refill. The drinks were $3.50 each so I spent over $10 for soda. The food is a little expensive for lunch ($25) but the food was excellent and worth it. Had I been told they charged for refills I probably still would have ordered but not had sticker shock when I got the bill. They really should have it printed on the menu or at least have the wait staff inform the customers. It sure took away from what was a great experience before getting the bill.,6esk80jEvm6Mb5MAPFbi9w,2021-11-04 20:01:52,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,3,Richard
djivGyip2Uo3Mol_NLsIJg,"While New Orleans isn't lacking Vietnamese food, Elizabeth Street Cafe does not disappoint. Located at St. Vincent, the patio is a beautiful spot to grab lunch and drinks. I will be returning for happy hour: half off báhn mi and appetizers. Everything we ordered enjoyed immensely. The portions are much larger than we anticipated (example A: huge spring rolls). Ginger chili-oil dumpling were delightful as was the Redfish Fried Rice. Regretfully, I was too full for dessert but the eclairs and croissants were calling my name as I left...",mzbxVF6u8LH8wnwUWGeAbQ,2021-11-14 05:34:27,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Madison
5BHtPoMiJ3To-aESa4NwJw,"Lovely location in a lovely hotel. Great experience overall.Tremendous happy hour. 1/2 off appetizers and banh mi. $2 off cocktails, beer, wine.The food was pretty good. Chili oil dumplings were okay. Crispy/fried pork banh mi was pretty good as well. Good flavoring, slightly overpowered by the mint though but it was okay once I took some of it out.Dine in with table service available. Nice patio with outdoor seating. I'll be back to check out the other items on a nice day.",6_VZC1O_WcmoEg54M-hCFQ,2022-01-01 21:36:48,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,4,Alexander
ViFkx8FWLjF3ibX_A40uDg,"We were warmly greeted and seated promptly, orders placed, and our food and drinks arrived quickly.  The plates were gorgeous and the sauces are spectacular.  Our daughter ordered the sautéed (yawn) tofu salad and to my astonishment it tasted fabulous, spicy and perfectly marinated and pan- browned.  The drinks were good, too, my margarita was served with a dollop of sciracha, yum.",D2-6IUsPtiF5tWES-98Vbw,2022-01-06 16:38:28,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Anne
5yblWqnzwPMt6OvNBtU8CQ,"This is a charming little joint outside the Hotel St. Vincent. It could be easy to miss the unassuming spot because it's nestled into the parking lot, but totally worth it. The Vietnamese menu hits the spot. I got the tofu banh mi, which was a perfect portion to fill me up. One of my friends got a noodle bowl, and I was astonished at how big the serving was. Didn't keep him from finishing, though. I wish I would have gotten some pictures of the food and the space, but hopefully I'll be back at some point, maybe during the day for better lighting, and can remedy that. The service was also phenomenal.",xpcb1eyHT44iT2pi_WdeWg,2021-10-24 13:02:09,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Derek
SxsChO9izzVnldYsZtumtQ,"Have you seen a more beautiful croissant This almond croissant was so flaky, perfectly cooked on the outside,in my opinion, and filled with an almond cream. Along with their delicious Vietnamese coffee. You can get it from Elizabeth Street Cafe at Hotel St.Vincent at their adorable French-Vietnamese cafe and bakery. French bakery and Brunch by morning and Vietnamese cafe by evening. You can still get some pastries during their lunch hour if they have any left from the morning. Welcome to hotel guest and locals! Perfect for a beautiful day. Dogs welcomed.",7gNXvlfb888IY3OdPmeyGw,2022-01-15 17:10:02,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,4,Chandler
dIVzFHIkjwlU7kaXjzV4aQ,I had a good meal at Elizabeth Street Cafe! They have a happy hour from 3-6 PM on weekdays where there is half off appetizers and bahn mis. I got the chili oil dumplings which I really enjoyed though they were not super spicy. I also got the grilled pork bahn mi which was pretty good though the meat was a little dry. The service was great and it is very pleasant to eat outside under the umbrellas and misters. I would go back to try more of the menu.,a5XvEtYqTIHpRarDlJ1v8w,2021-11-04 18:16:11,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,5,Emily
ad3gS7SgYxM6Oyei71vwqw,"NOLA has a large amount of Vietnamese food but with Elizabeth's coming into St. Vincent's hotel, it brings a different vibe compared to many other vietnamese restaurants.While still tasting good, they decided to mix it up a bit and take the cuisine to the next level with some modern amenities such as a great courtyard, cocktails, & wait staff.Here is their Dan Dan Noodles (not Vietnamese), Banh Xeo [Vietnamese Savory Crepe], and some yummy dumplings!@phidingthefam",C29mwZb95W3BDDaz2apFUg,2021-11-29 21:11:05,3CcQS_pHoq9RPaOWYlo_7Q,4,Vince
