0LZVHYarhUP1Wxz5fJ6vng,"Located right off of the 1st floor lobby. Wonderful spot to work, they've got outlets and WiFi readily available. Wonderful cocktails, my favorite is lavender fizz. Service is wonderful and friendly staff",lkuUwfhRtnTJkpEqsTMO7A,2021-12-16 01:04:16,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,CeCi
tjXp2NeNetnovdgcvYnJZQ,Wow oh wow! This place exceeded all my expectations. The bar is gorgeous. The decorations in the area are quite extraordinary yet simple.  The rabbit theme is adorable at the hotel and pet friendly.  The rooftop pool is AMAZING! I am just waiting for NOLA to realize this gem and expect a wait. It was so simple to get in. I ordered a French 75 and it was great. I will go back for dinner. My girls need a night out there.,Er_1k4cl0VwKz9tfIn-FBw,2021-08-26 19:37:14,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,Lynn
_oal5iyARHWsDM-SvGIfVg,"My friends and I had so much fun here.  All of the drinks were perfect and we enjoyed our meal too!  We all ordered different things and ate family style! It's prob one of my favorite things to do when going to a restaurant for the first time.  When entering the hotel, we received a band that gave us access to the different bars and rooftop.  The interior is super fun and vibrant! We can't wait to visit again.",Cwr68RezVlwLmh4EZ1aZEQ,2021-10-31 04:26:43,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,Tomi
-ndxRM6D6VbQS9oBntxaYg,Not an extensive menu but what we had was top-notch. Had pappardelle with gulf shrimp and eggplant which was one of the best pasta dishes we have had in a restaurant recently. The smashed Waygu burger was great. Excellent wine list. Again not extensive but well sourced. Excellent service. Beautiful restaurant and lobby.,6Y5jT0xfYBmXWkBOqwDTjw,2021-12-04 21:44:46,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,Gary
HfrssW4k_A0ucwbRtrIvoQ,"I decided to check this out on a recommendation from a friend and I LOVED it! The atmosphere was fresh and inviting, but the best part was the service. The servers were attentive and Brian was the BEST bartender--his drinks were delicious. As a local, I generally don't love going to hotel bars/ restaurants but the drinks and food were worth it. The mushroom fritters taste like stuffing-- pure heaven.  Definitely a must see!",Ymwmck4DAeKypMh6FcqvGQ,2021-09-26 02:40:48,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,Aly
kVNRx-T2fTMQq0sl7JYvRw,"Okay, this place is definitely photo worthy. When you walk in the ambiance hits you. The bold colors, funky designs, and the cool layout it's dark, cozy, fresh and def give me vibes of NY or LA. I loved it. The service was a little poor but I will assume it's because they were extremely busy or just short staffed. We waited an hour just to get our drinks and 2 hours just to get food. It was rough but we tried rill to remain positive. The food was good but lukewarm I honestly think the waitress forgot about our food. We had to inquire about it and then in seconds she was walking out with it. I ordered the shrimp pasta dish and a friend of mine ordered a vegan option. Both were satisfying and fresh. You can tell the noodles were made in house and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. Overall, I enjoyed the experience and would visit again just to see if service improved.",qmkiQ0FQdBEDKYIyikS4-A,2021-11-07 12:41:54,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,3,Meagan
MgALknLYQlxRDi_iNP4o0g,Super stylish and low key at the same time. A nice break from tourist traps. The food was good but honestly in was the design concept that had me wanting more. Such a cute spot! Great cocktails. I had the pork chop and it was delicious. My partner did not love the fish. His sweet potato purée portion was tiny and tasted like baby food. Fish needed some kind of sauce just seared with a fishy after taste. The coquette were very yummy. Must try appetizer. Dress up and enjoy the bougie ambiance. You won't regret it.,cn_xRZj9wlIGkpVQ_Kbi4w,2021-11-17 06:42:48,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,4,Nicole
tHlYeDIotJOPrJvz05StBA,"The selling point to the commons club is the super instagram-able decor and relaxed sweet staff. It's a bright, trendy series of small dining areas that each have their own living style. I could see using different areas for different events like brunch with a bestie or a celebration dinner with a large group. The drinks are also top notch! Both in taste and presentation. I had the Santa Fe Spa Water, a refreshing take on a Margarita. We also ordered a Dole Whip, a nod to the Disney favorite.The food was good, but not particularly outstanding.  Brunch options include salads, soups, avocado toast, a burger, etc.  We enjoyed everything but I wouldn't go back just for the food.  The cocktails and atmosphere were great and I'd love to try dinner.",7lTCFIslGM0MXlMvd2Mu9w,2021-12-10 17:05:28,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,4,Kimberly
y8E8SKuA7AGFdggAbNCIpg,Food was amazing. Service not so much. Our reservation was at 8:30 we thought we would show early to see if they could seat us. If not we would go to the bar. They said they could not seat us even though we could see plenty of tables. We went to the bar and waited until 8:50pm and we weee finally seated after having to hunt someone down. Then we were seated and our server didn't come to our table for about 15 minutes. When he finally did we ordered and our appetizer came out within 15 minutes and our food an hour later. They apologized a few times and asked if we wanted dessert on the house. We declined as we were trying to be out of there at a certain time. So if you don't mind waiting 1.5 hours for your food in an empty restaurant it's worth it.,z-pJ0DtlsTNNuvSv6cY6ag,2022-01-03 18:55:46,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,3,Dyamond
aw2_bzD5zPZ6wgDW9ixp-g,"This place is so cool-ambiance is romantic with an industrial chic vibe. Food and drinks are great, service is good.Went last night for date night and sat at the beautiful bar. We got the Saturn's son and Mr. Espresso to drink (the former tasted like a margarita martini, and the latter was a solid classic). Then we got the little gem lettuce salad (nice and fresh with a ton of dill, just texture variation with some sliced cucumbers, beets, and crunchy quinoa maybe? Sprinkled on top) and the mushroom fritters (yummy, more like a hush puppy, got a bunch of them-maybe 6-7, with a nice creamy remoulade for dipping). We definitely enjoyed ourselves at this laid back but upscale establishment, and plan to be back plenty in the future.",eVSl6sLpS6_mUucMZ4cB5g,2021-12-30 16:03:14,rrd9QThX5G728RprMsxcGA,5,Haley
