_-QdKQrE9rwaETR3KjgdXg,We stopped by Pomelo on a weekday while looking for Thai food and we were so glad to have visited this restaurant. The food was nicely seasoned and slightly spicy. The glass noodles and salmon curry were our favorites; we can't wait to come back and try the rest of the menu! Also FYI: this place is byob so bring your favorite bottle of wine!,QrhGSyzOwhOqHliW0Oemow,2021-11-29 04:24:55,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Michaela

yXwuI87AWVzFy3BkYL1HpA,"This is a lovely little starter place for a new restaurant. They strive harder than most non-domestic-cuisine restaurants to provide authentic cuisine and nail it, so far as I can tell. For those used to casual dining in a U.S. setting, you may find the number of options wanting; however, I find that I would rather go to a place that had fewer options and can execute them well. That describes Pomelo. Both dishes that I tried-- the Chicken Massaman and the Pok Pok Noodle--were well-spiced and were generous portions of food for the price. At three booth-chair hybrid (seats four) and three intimate table setting (seats two) options, the size is humble. This size leads to the only criticism I could offer--the amount of acoustics are too high. A four-person group cam in and was very loud, leading to a much louder than usual experience. I suspect that the minimal décor might contribute to the volume, and as they add some objects the sound might be less likely to bounce. I would also like to see yam sam-o added to the menu, as I understand that this salad is the name sake for their restaurant--Pomelo. Our server was the husband of the female proprietor, a distinguished Loyola Professor. Both of them  are very kind and helpful, with stories for each of the menu items. Generally being pretty hesitant with my 5-star reviews, I found this place to be reasonably worthy. They are in a start-up stage (likely no more than a couple months old), but they seem to care deeply about bringing an authentic Thai taste to you and delivering good service. I can happily suggest that you check them out, especially if you are feeling adventurous and like giving smaller places a chance. I suggest making a reservation if you are not making a spur of the moment eating decision.",nJFyLXf3evkomGjP0bd4uw,2021-12-21 18:01:54,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,David

HpEIzsi1aEQvsXaH_TvOVg,I dropped by for lunch takeout     Got the seafood salad (noodles).   Very tasty and spicy (like Thai should be).   I will definitely drop in again to try their other dishes.,0IPxfeKByAOW5dNRFfYetw,2021-11-13 18:12:34,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,4,D

pAjT3imIZc7jRwVruN9Xlw,"Wow! What a sweet surprise! We were walking up Magazine looking for a place to eat dinner and came across this amazing authentic Thai restaurant. We ordered the chicken massaman and the pumpkin green curry. Both dishes were absolutely delicious and a perfect sharing size for the 3 of us. We were able to meet the owners Aom and Frankie who were so welcoming and offered us wonderful conversation. Aom is from Thailand and brings her unique recipes to life with her tasty food and her contagious smile. This restaurant has only been open for a little over a week and we can't wait to be back to try more of their menu! If you like Thai, do yourself a favor and come try it out!",NmBZEmQ0hefNfHcheabx5Q,2021-10-25 03:07:58,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Casey
DemvPjVGmtpuGhco1j0udg,"Made my second trip to Pomelo this week. Aom has opened a gem on Magazine St. I've had the Pomelo Ramen (amazing), chicken massman (delicious, be sure to ask for extra rice so you don't let any of the sauce go to waste), glass noodle salad (spicy good -- and the sauce livens up some of the rice you have left over) and green pumpkin curry (good....and I'm not a big curry fan). Everything has a freshness and tastiness that makes it delightful.  And the addition of Frankie's Famous Brownies is a nice finish (it's not on the menu but be sure to ask for it. You won't be disappointed). When you go, be sure to say hi to Aom and look around. I might be there as Pomelo is going to a regular stop for me.",4JH_lNxi7k7bfGV4ZOgTfw,2021-11-19 17:12:20,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Dale
QadDfjDrEfBpXyPuq8yrkA,"This place SLAPS. Mouthwatering food. Friendly proprietors and staff - walked in on Christmas Eve and everyone was so welcoming. Chic decor. Absolutely a must try.Chicken Massaman - fall off the bone tender chicken, fragrant sauce, aesthetically platedFriends loved the vegetarian green curry and pok pok noodlesSmaller storefront on Magazine street, probably about 8-10 smaller tables. Some tables out front as well. Seems like you may be able to make reservations, so if able to would definitely recommend thatWith that being said, they do have a smaller menu, but they have both meat, seafood, and vegetarian options. Moreover, IIRC the menu said something about constantly rotating items. Definitely will be back to try the rest of the items on the menu, and will absolutely be on the lookout for new items to try*** Also it's BYOB***",6_VZC1O_WcmoEg54M-hCFQ,2021-12-27 05:32:58,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Alexander

pZGgd9BbfuYwMVo1Sl2cgw,This is some of the best Thai food I have had in the U.S.! I spent over a month in Thailand years ago and the cooking here reminds me of some of my favorite places there. Everything is so fresh! The staff is wonderful as well!,ZHCgygCUB-_KMfCeiTRR-w,2021-11-05 17:55:42,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Stacey
b5e_f_TjxvFvp-Y8h6cYwQ,"The minute you walk through the door, you join the family. These are loving people ( even Joe) who will do anything for you. The Tom Kah ( veggie style) was perfect. A made to order mango salad with glass noodles was delicious. I love this little space with almost a school room feel. I would dim the lights and work on being able to serve wine. BYOL right now. Must try",9so68GtSENK671ZCE74E9A,2021-12-18 15:56:28,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,4,CAROLYN
qpV5MoqkS5CsUW0asncbEw,Amazing Thai food - not the run of the mill stuff.  The green curry was amazing. Loved the glass noodle salad. Really cute bistro style restaurant. Will definitely be back!,XDn29oAmk916My3ADFHQZQ,2021-11-08 01:34:26,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Mike
78VvuY9tfDe2-blJza0VUA,I saw someone's review of this place pop up on my Google Maps when I was nearby with a picture of their corn shrimp salad and I knew I had to have it. I popped in while they were closed 3-5 but Frankie and Aom (and Leah) were so great and made me the salad anyways! It was SO GOOD and had the perfect kick. This place is delicious and very fairly priced-- and the staff couldn't have been nicer!! I'm definitely coming back again and again!,2n7rf3WK1J29VTmDBce1cw,2021-12-04 21:43:59,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Julia

PhSbsm-0az3mvGHsbWIMLw,"Ordered to-go tonight and everything was amazing. So much flavor in all the dishes. The Pok Pok noodle was amazing. The broth was robust yet so clean, you could really taste everything in it. The perfect option for those cold or post drinking days that you crave ramen or pho. The rich flavor explosion of a ramen with the lightness of a pho. The sweet corn and shrimp salad provided the perfect balance to the spice/heartiness of the other dishes. Best Thai I've ever had in Nola and maybe anywhere for that matter. Owners are super nice too. 10/10!",3yJWn7pwOoFZLsseJehXaQ,2022-01-15 02:45:52,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Mark
lprRlK9fQy9c1u3SVoxm1A,"Lovely small and delicious new spot in town! My friend had her 40th birthday, it was a party of 8 and service was incredibly fast and the food was amazing! The salmon red curry, seafood glass noodle salad and green pumpkin curry were all spectacular.  It's BYOB til they get their liquor license but honestly it made the party more fun. And they held a cake in the kitchen for us as well as bottles. Great service, great food. Highly recommend!",fxwGbKV5ApywEAgJAtWibA,2021-11-07 01:57:40,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Ashley

D6qyxqd-p5_qpC2lVwIMMg,"Tried Pomelo this past weekend & got their crowd favorite--pumpkin green curry! They use chicken thigh instead of breast, so the chicken isn't dry at all, and the meat on the drumstick fell straight off the bone. Spice level was perfect--enough to notice it but not too much that you can't appreciate the rest of the flavors in the curry. The pumpkin element is more like eating a green curry with squash, so not an actual pumpkin-flavored curry-- just an fyi for anyone expecting anything different. The rice was also ~~perfectly~~ cooked (which, imo, is the best sign as to whether a place is actually good or not). The owner is this sweet Thai woman and service was timely + responsive!! Since the place is about a month old, there wasn't a wait either. **would recommend** if you want some authentic Thai food. I'm definitely coming back to try their shrimp/corn salad and glass noodles :)",vf4hzq5HrgZSdNLACtrjEA,2021-11-23 22:47:43,7uFQqkUJUNu8XBo1nh8DTw,5,Theresa
