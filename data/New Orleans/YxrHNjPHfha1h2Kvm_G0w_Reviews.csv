keHmTTZKWxV7IydFZZUNJQ,Great restaurant and bar in the east. I really liked the fish plate and seafood stuffed pepper. I hear they also have great tacos on Tuesdays. Bar is small but patio has a few seats.,Er_1k4cl0VwKz9tfIn-FBw,2021-06-07 00:13:00,-YxrHNjPHfha1h2Kvm_G0w,5,Lynn

It's a BoB located on Hayne next door to Castnet, which is a fresh seafood and seafood platter staple in N.O. East. If you enjoy being around good people (5/5), a laid back atmosphere (5/5) and delicious food, this is the place for you! EVERYONE is friendly (staff and patrons alike), the food is tasty, you can dance, watch sports and play the machines. If you like ""spirits"", there's everything from Proper 12 to vodka ""set ups"". The margaritas are so good, there's a huge jug of it on the counter. If you enjoy good soul food or food specials, their daily specials (Taco Tuesday, Fish Fridays, Stuffed Bell Peppers on Sunday) and regular offerings are delightful. Fried or grilled fish - (5/5) Served with Mac n cheese, potato salad and green peas. Nice portion and served piping hot. Highly recommend. Stuffed Bell Pepper - (5/5) Absolutely THE BEST stuffed bell pepper I've ever had in a restaurant setting. Filled with ingredients Momma uses at home. A must try! Yakamein (3/5) - It's beef only. Very good flavor but the noodles weren't right. It's a Nola thing especially after a long night and very few places offer this after 7p. It wasn't a favorite. Gumbo (3/5) - Different stroke for different folks. Not my roux of choice (tomato like) but it has all the other fixings I like   (shrimp, okra, sausage, etc) and it was recommended by another patron on my first visit.  Taco plates (4/5) - consists of three tacos, a side of corn, taco sauce, sour cream and pico. I tried three types: chicken and shrimp (5/5) beef/birria (5/5) and shrimp only (3,5/5). Surf & turf is also available. Margaritas (5/5) - I'm in lust! Can't get enough of the prickly pear! If you love a tart, ""wine candy"" (jolly rancher) type flavor, this is for you! That said, the peach marg is tasty too and a better choice if you prefer sweet flavors. Other flavors (including watermelon) are also available but they remain on my ""to try"" list.",WJR8f_QNG1kuPq5V6RxeFA,2021-12-15 10:19:40,-YxrHNjPHfha1h2Kvm_G0w,5,Trina
E5sTr46EVoHDJyVQkJ9s-Q,"A hidden gem ! This food was so good we ordered it twice in one night ! It is also a bar but outdoor seating is available. The bartenders were very nice and friendly. I called and ordered ahead. I ordered the beef and one chicken. Each order comes with 3 tacos, sauce, elotes and various toppings. Now onto the delicious tasty make your mouth holler food! The combination of the melting cheese, tender beef and the dipping sauce was all to amazing. I didn't realize what I was missing out on with these tacos. The flavors were so tasty. I don't think I ever ate a taco so quickly . Forget the toppings you really don't need them. The corn also got a splash of the sauce and it set those flavors off too. The sweet corn and a sprinkle of cheese were just perfect. This will be my permanent taco Tuesday spot! They've for sure won me over. Prices are reasonable and worth it. Next time I'll try the street corn.",JRMIB3YI-rwnL_t0kr_Qsg,2021-05-12 11:35:25,-YxrHNjPHfha1h2Kvm_G0w,5,Robin
