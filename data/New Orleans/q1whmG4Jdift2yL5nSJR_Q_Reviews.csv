ihrEjzGDLCflzd97c6DKhg,"I was a little hesitant to check this place out since it only had 1 review thus far, but glad we didn't let that deter us. We had been somewhere else and the menu only had 1 option that even looked good, so it was great when we got here and I immediately saw 4-5 things I was excited about. We landed on the tuna and avocado roll, spicy kimchi udon, and teriyaki hot plate. I really appreciate that the roll was only $7.50 and the slices were not so large I felt like I needed to cut them, which isn't really possible with chop sticks. My udon was good although not spicy at all. The bf liked the teriyaki plate but just be aware that the meat is not cooked in the sauce so it may not be as strong of a flavor. All-in-all we will definitely come back to try some Ramen and a few other things!",2FThL9VtdO9lsaThpzi4wQ,2021-10-02 15:44:13,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,4,Meghan
UfLQrGvt5PKdo1XgUFtHOw,Ordered delivery from them and it was ready in less than 15 minutes. I ordered a mild mie tek tek and it was just spicy enough:) I also asked to have rice noodles and they did it for no charge! The free little fried pork skins are super good too.,mBjWcX2OkE3NJzaLHWRTGQ,2021-11-17 03:30:40,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Hannah
u7R0nYYCD-5HwIvu-nBmtQ,"extremely average ramen! kind of bland, and they didn't even give us an egg in our ramen, which is mentioned to be included with any bowl. server was very inattentive and kind of careless. atmosphere was super weird with random new orleans jazz that went on and off randomly. lol",7ohiNvcBd7oMemLNGeKlhw,2021-10-23 02:45:17,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,3,Audrey

36z1XWTqENjwq27jecwCPA,Hangout ramen is my go to place for ramen and sushi! I have been 3 times and every time they impress me! The ramen is always so flavorful and has a good spice to it! The sushi is rolled well and is always presented beautifully. Such a great menu they have there!,tjrgiw_A4rpGgBv2etF0OA,2022-01-03 00:37:36,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Jordan
UeQBHlQeeyREQLl7ngKyGw,Went here for their variety of Asian dishes and the sushi is the best part. We had a Burning Man roll and it was the best one I've had anywhere in the city. I can't stop thinking about it! I thought their ramen was just alright but I will definitely be going back for more sushi and their assortment of fried rice dishes!,xLYeWfQZ3A28nDsRTgTIug,2021-09-18 00:11:07,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,4,Jam
Vf2o4xP1wRp7x8mElglxEQ,"Very casual and delicious place to get sushi, ramen, and fried rice. We tried the burning women roll with no asparagus, chicken katsu ramen, and the hangout ramen. It was all very good and we will be coming back for sure!",xGLPPWC4i4qqUdxBIKoZeQ,2021-11-30 02:12:37,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Kellie
aw218gvPwitE07GAAL8YuQ,so glad they opened up - I got to have pre-hurricane pork ramen and agedashi tofu which absolutely hit the spot. Will be back to eat my way through the rest of the menu.Tx for the free sake as an opening treat!,j6heMfak9MIKIk3xY842Ww,2021-09-04 18:51:49,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Eos
LuaAuaqyZks4VOmFHI7N7Q,"I'm not always one for Ramen, but as the weather has finally felt a bit more like fall,it seemed like time to finally try this place out. I made the mistake of not checking the listing before heading inside,I just saw the open sign in the window.  Turns out, I showed up just as they were closing for their lunch time.  Thankfully, the server was so sweet,she said if we could order, she'd catch the kitchen before they closed down for their afternoon break. We made quick work of a simple late lunch, and it was absolutely delicious!It was one of those hangover feeling type of days, so nothing crazy was required, but they have all kinds of ramen, sushi, teriyaki, fried rice.... All the yumminess!  It came out hot and fast,and was absolutely perfect for the easy lunch we were hoping for. Huge fan of the ramen and the fried rice, and I can't wait to go back and try out more of the menu.  And, I promise,I won't go at closing as I'm now that's a huge pet peeve and I don't ever want to be ""that guy""!",AIjA_jJQyAhoxtYd335Ekg,2021-11-16 02:59:20,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Jes
Mv4dtu0oFBLO_luMHegFHg,Didn't like anything we ordered and it was pretty expensive for the quality and quantity. The Pad Thai tasted like fish food. The service was really nonexistent.,VTAsWrOKIrljJ5xYw8I92Q,2022-01-03 02:47:38,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,2,Jennifer
LN9-cS1BKdIzrpb2n87RaQ,I ordered the hangout ramen via Uber eats and it was packaged very well and fresh. The broth had a great depth of flavor and the pork belly was extremely tender and flavorful. I would in the future pay the extra $2 for the fresh hand pulled noodles but overall a great meal!,lB_0K2yvRxFvjnUWyZRicA,2021-12-09 16:09:36,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Sarah
taSrGHIChIN4ziKqld5gIQ,"This place was huge. Anyone know what it used to be? Anyway, we cane here for dinner one someone chilly night looking for so ramen. We've been getting spoiled here with Kin and Union opening in the last few years. (So sad Kin is closed for good now). Anyway, we ordse some sushi to start and that rice was perfection. I really enjoyed the sushi alot. I also order the hangout ichimi ramen. I was going to order the heat as burning but I stuck with mild when the waitress said burning was too hot for her. There are three levels of heat. It comes with pork belly and that was tender and flavorful! The shrimp were fried on a stick, just thought that was oddly served that way. I guess I thought it would be sautéed or boiled shrimp in the ramen. The egg unfortunately did not have much soaked in broth flavors. I am guessing they don't cook the egg with the broth. The broth itself had great flavor and some heat so I can see why I may never be able to go with the burning heat level. I absolutely loved the extra corn I got, those were soaked in the flavors and so good. I felt the noodles were a but thin, I do prefer them to be a little thicker. It was a huge portion and I ate all of it. The service was great here as well. What a great addition to our city!",pgtmWFEicHOl07aTjMnQTA,2021-11-15 04:48:22,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,4,Jamie

MG6WSuKsrkfYxXGgQWfEtQ,"I was so exited to try this place after reading about them online. But, after Trying them, I was totally disappointed. The miso/tofu ramen was so bland, I needed 3-4 ingredients to make it better. Then, the menu states the Vegetarian Ramen is purely veg. Well, until you bite into a fish cake, you wouldn't know better. I confirmed twice that there wasn't seafood in my dish, but again disappointed that there was no taste and rubber fish cakes in my dish :(My friend wasn't to keen on her pork ramen either. Very bland. Sorry, but we won't return.",sbAD1gbfLfdT2N3V5bDjDw,2021-10-21 03:01:16,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,3,Nola
rYe5J7DNjzPX4u5eYbxPRQ,"I just had a delicious lunch at Hangout Ramen.So as crazy as it seems, the only ramen I've ever had has come from a plastic bag and costs around 25 cents.  Well, as you can imagine, this was a treat.I was warmly welcomed when I arrived and was given menus right away.  I ordered a hot green tea and Tonkotsu Ramen, which was described on the menu as creamy pork broth and pork belly.  Well, as it turns out it's much more than that. All of the ramen bowls come with corn, bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, fish cakes, egg, green onion and seaweed sheets.Y'all, this stuff is good. Like solid good.  I loved it and am looking forward to a return trip.  The pork belly was so tender that it was  literally falling apart. The broth was very flavorful and this was really a hearty dish. I have a feeling that when I return I'll order the same dish because 1. that's who I am, and 2. it was that good.The service was wonderful too.",4YyJpeAr6jsY0FaIbLiTSQ,2022-01-10 19:27:12,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Patricia

D8DOE9YfBxY-N_wXcba3eg,"Clear soup was good. Ramen was bad. All of the ingredients were completely raw, including the Bok Choy- except for the egg which was over cooked. There was so many bean sprouts that we had a hard time digging through them to get to the noodles",L10O0_jXu4-HRlul8wIHWA,2022-01-02 21:38:43,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,1,Kaila
U3urf1ls3NpsTLdIZpuSXg,"Good ramen is hard to come by in this city. There just simply isn't enough great selection. I was pretty impressed by the overall complex flavors of my broth and extremely impressed by the pork chashu inside the ramen and our pork bao.We were seated immediately and was offered free sake. I passed on the free sake but changed my mind. The free sake is not something to write home about, it's flavors are not the best but it's free so no complaints. If you like sake you might look for a mouthfeel that is subtly sweet and nutty from the grains, but the sake itself is mostly a quick hit of alcohol with subtle rice aromatics. But once again it was free and the sentiments were nice.We started off with three appetizers:Crawfish gyozas: these were okay, we weren't enthusiastic about it. It's served with sweet chili sauce, very likely Maeploy brand. Agedashi Tofu: these were less than okay. For a couple blocks of tofu the rice-flour coated tofu were very plain on its own (understandably) but the dashi-soy sauce was also very plain. Overall plain and bland was the takeaway of this dish.Pork Chashu Bun: it's in a crescent style bun and the pork chashu was perfect! Delicious! Just salty enough and just sweet enough it literally melted in our mouths. The cook on the pork belly was extremely well executed. I was impressed! I ordered two more orders to go for my family!Bang Bang Ramen: my partner got this ramen and I tasted the broth. Can't really remember the flavors well but I enjoyed it and that was what matters.Hangout Ichimi Ramen: I got it at explode. As a spicy food connoisseur I looooove spicy food. The explode was not an intense spice but it was really well done. I'm not sure if they make their own chili-garlic spices but it reminded me of schezuan spice like LaoGanMa. The pork inside the ramen was the same pork from the bao so naturally it was really tender and yummy. The soft boiled eggs were seasoned well, the noodles were good, and the broth was delicious. I literally drank the whole bowl. Overall pretty impressed!",SAZJ4KUljx4Q6JEzjYKmyg,2021-10-05 17:25:28,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Siamrath
BUEwlWP_9DcGEo3Aoku4Sg,"Third times the charm for this Japaneseinspired restaurant location. One thing that been consistent though, is quality Ramen.  I started off rocky, like Masterpiece before them, answering the phone is hit or miss. I called 4 times and had tried on other days with no answer so I just showed up to order in person. They offer Uber Eats and Waiter orders but for a fee. Despite the disappointment of having to sit and wait for take out, they were fast and efficient with service. The phone rang often, the dining room was full and online orders were constant, so I can see why you won't always get an answer. It only took about 10min for my Spicy Bang Bang Ramen to be ready. One bite at home and all was forgiven. It's the perfect level of spice for me, enough to feel it but still enjoy all the flavors of their creamy rich Pork broth. There was a larger amount of pork belly than usual, the noodles were fresh, had great pull, and the egg was perfection! Even the corn that is included (extra at other spots) was an on point sweet and crisp addition to the dish. I've heard great things about their sushi and saw a few Other ramens I'd like to try but it's going to be hard not to revisit the spicy bang bang over and over (even if I have to wait at the counter ).  Grateful Hangout is so close!!",7lTCFIslGM0MXlMvd2Mu9w,2021-11-15 18:33:22,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,4,Kimberly
mtxHvrkatn3haDUlhYe5QA,"Delicious surprise!  I've driven past here many times and wondered about it, so I finally ordered delivery on a rainy evening and I'm very happy.  I had the pork buns for an appetizer (yum! I could eat these every day : ) and also ordered the mie tek tek, which I got at the medium spicy level for my first try; it's wonderful, and I also got side of their house chili sauce for some extra zip.  There are more things I want to try on the menu, so I'll try them again for sure.",c_1B0a5S_gm9YyXyZV_xVg,2021-12-07 01:49:58,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,5,Anne

0SNo9Pfbr_Nf-ajN49a2_w,"Food was fantastic! Server was very attentive. New restaurant in a weird location so it was pretty empty. The dining style was set up actually more formal than what one might expect.Cons: The ramen is pricey (yet worth it). If you want yours spicy, make sure you seriously LOVE spice, because the lowest level had my friend wiping tears from his eyes and left me being like ""is the food hot or is it just the spice?"". I still ate mine though. Weird: They only played Bruno Mars. Got annoying after a while. Would go back, but please play something else.",y1vHYFQXSu0qQS10DzI7lg,2022-01-08 19:44:00,q1whmG4Jdift2yL5nSJR_Q,4,Addonis
