Ujf4VpKe4CiaD_uJuBV9yA,"My experience at Pluck was spot on from the service, decor, food and the wine. The space is absolutely beautiful and a very comfortable place to let the hours pass by. The food was comforting and excellent. It all paired nicely with the wines. The wine list is extensive and incredibly interesting. There is a large selection of reasonably priced wines by the glass. All much better than wines you will find around town. All the wines by the bottle are ones that were thoughtfully curated by the owners and can fit anyones budget from reasonable to some of the most acclaimed bottles in the world. Pluck is truly a haven for wine lovers and a welcome addition to this ever evolving city.",i_kePggd0UaejtOaNGAS1g,2021-04-15 21:07:21,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,E
9jkZjIfNgPdI_viEMUjAFw,"I rarely submit reviews but this is a great spot and I feel like I'd be doing curious yelpers a disservice by not reviewing. I am traveling to Florida from Texas and was in NOLA for a night when I stumbled across this wine bar. The service was fantastic, particularly Luis who helped me choose a few different glasses of wine based on my terribly vague description of what I like. The venue had good energy and a relaxed vibe (vs. a stuffy, pretentious feel). The wine list was unique and comprehensive and the food was tailored to the wine which seems like a random comment but this isn't done at most places. The staff was passionate about wine and the pluck story which was refreshing - you don't usually see this from the people on the front lines. I travel often and rarely feel strongly one way or another about the restaurants / bars I go to but I highly recommend you check this place out. You won't be disappointed.",8KLJ6gBX2O-0ejRLYaJ9cg,2021-04-27 04:48:58,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,John
5lqtYNZQMlF0iMLub246Gw,This place is so adorable.   Great bites! Great wines and bubbles.   The decor is amazing and the vibe is just right! Very happy with the choice to come here.  Service was amazing. Check this gem out!,fqInotw9fGYo3ZS7KWaMLQ,2021-06-26 18:35:05,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,David
i1bWvOQOe21g7eq942Q_kw,"Amazing little wine bar in the CBD. The staff is incredible and super knowledgeable about the wines. They also have a great food menu and the kitchen stays open late. Definitely a plus in New Orleans where it's impossible to get good food after 10. Get the quail or the frog legs. Yum! I hear it's the chef from the former Mimis. If so, he's gotten even better. Plus they play Biz Markie on the stereo and have a nice sofa. I'll definitely b",gaTGMI19Fuq8JvsLy_-gFA,2021-11-05 03:22:35,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,michael
2rjZoNyQpNUHmx52cQ1Jow,"Starting this review by noting I always give restaurants the benefit of the doubt (especially during covid) and rarely rate an experience but this was exceptionally bad and by far the worst service I have experienced while living in New Orleans period. Once the 'new' wears off of this place I don't imagine it will be open long...After multiple friends had recommended this spot I decided to take my parents while they were in town visiting. We were seated at 5pm (they just opened and were not busy at all). Our waitress took our order for a few appetizers and drinks. Our party finished our drinks and appetizers and it took her 15 min to clear my moms drink - which when she took it she did not ask if she would like another nor did she ask if we would like more food or drinks for the table. After 30 min of blatantly being ignored by not only our waitress but the other wait staff we had to verbally request  (twice) that another waiter close out or tab. Even after this, our waitress never came to our table even though she continued to pass us to serve others. We were planning on spending our evening here, ordering multiple courses and rounds but instead were run off to finish our evening at a different restaurant. Overall this location is overpriced and overhyped. The food and service are subpar (cheese and meat board - ""chefs choice"" was below average when compared to cheese and meat offerings at Trader Joe's but costs $35, tuna crostini is almost flavorless, wait staff makes no effort to discuss wine offerings though self professed wine bar). This is yet another trendy spot for photos with zero substance -  the food and service leave much to be desired in a city full of greats.",9Hms5EBN4q3S6TDEtmbCTg,2021-04-24 03:55:19,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,1,Kali
xFSwGfUEqYfXfVDlGH2CqA,The wine list is AMAZING! Perfectly curated. Price points for everyone. Friendly and helpful staff. Bites are excellent as well. Can't wait to come back!,xv8wcOPSc9jmD2cFfYVb6g,2021-04-20 01:04:40,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Jeanne
rD552jZpQA8ac6osajDAmQ,Ok! They are AMAZING!! I've been at Pluck Wines 3 times and every time I enjoyed my experience there.  Here is why:Wine optionsCheese board options Unique dishes Bot too long and confusing menu Adorable Ambiance  Good service Just one suggestion: those round tables are so cute but small for 2 parties. I will be back soon!,Ebf9sWItfuzQ6FMcvVlzJg,2021-08-22 15:39:06,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Forough
mEs6HPG64j5Bot5Jj8C_Cw,"Great atmosphere and selection. I agree with another reviewer that it's a casual but chic vibe. Small place but great selection, nicely priced bites and wines by the glass. Note this is a wine bar, so no full bar options, just wine and beer.",NSDcKAteZ_sP4x58sXhxfQ,2021-06-18 01:39:48,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Liz
0xHnhV8RPIjj-yfqjglqLg,"I dined in about 2 or 3 weeks ago and I believe Emily was waiting on us. Not only was she super personable and friendly but she was attentive and patient with us.Now before I go into this detailed note of a review, keep in mind this was 3 weeks ago and my descriptions are at best..... elementary. Nonetheless, please enjoy!!I was starving but also have eyes that almost always want more than my stomach can handle. For appetizers, we had the tuna toast, it's definitely called something else, way more decorative than just tuna on toast. IT WAS SO GODDAMN GOOD!!!Had I not had eyes for everything on the menu, we wounded ended our meal with a second order.We also wound up getting a cheese plate. I wanna say there was goat cheese as the main with a fig sauce, homemade pickles and a cured ham. If it wasn't goat cheese it was definitely a funky cheese because why would you get anything other than a funky cheese?As a main, we had Shrimp with a pecan and a liqueur sauce of sorts; which I was very disappointed about when I first looked at it. The thing is; I was just complaining about how restaurants will charge you $35 for 4 small pieces of shrimp and here comes Emily with 3 pieces of shrimp and a piece of toast. Now though I can't recall the price I know we paid a fair amount or the plate. Nonetheless, not only were the shrimp a fair size but the combination of flavors paired in the plate to compliment the shrimp were so good I barely notice my ""small"" portion!We also had quail, which I don't recall ever having before. It was paired with a potato compote along with spinach.I was thoroughly satisfied... with everything. The wine was also crisp and delicious, perfect for a hot summers day!I know there are a lot of exclamations in my review but I can over communicate enough how much I enjoyed the food at this wine bar. Hats off to the chef, who at some point came out with one of our mains. I hadn't had a chance to thank him because I was partly working but Can't wait to go back and just enjoy the ambiance of the space!Sorry I hadn't caught better photos, as I mentioned I was hungry and everything looked so good, I just dived right in!",vCplqzi-egckYouKzzNtvw,2021-08-10 01:55:32,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Cmtl
ONoTIxLtpBO-utRG2mQ56A,"Great new spot in the CBD! Nice selection of wines and delicious bites. I stopped with a friend and we had some bubbles, the fried goat cheese (a fave holdover from Mimi's), and a cheese board. Asked for more bread which was delivered cheerfully. We ate outside which was a bit too hot - will definitely reserve inside next time. Totally worth a stop! I'll be back!",kIVlnCkkAscCfScYs4y2nQ,2021-07-01 22:22:25,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Courtney

xPAyOxlRg0F1mQIFSZMckg,My friends and I wandered in after dining nearby. We sat at the bar and had a great experience.   The atmosphere was classy but not pretentious.  The employees were friendly and knowledgeable.  They gave us a few suggestions and each one was spot on. Also the meat and cheese plate was delicious!,yKNzW-3xKqN499TuWfO5HQ,2021-07-12 02:10:26,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,4,Dianne
qjQ82htjrtm6kcCTQdU4Hg,Absolutely LOVE this place! Wine choices are sooo unique and very good!! Upscale dining and perfect date night! The best frog legs we've ever had! Lobster simply outstanding! We eat out and sip wine a lot and we want to go back to NOLA just to dine at Pluck again!! Wishing you the best post hurricane!! Hope to be there again soon!,PwasBNT31vnO30baU5TqPQ,2021-10-04 03:09:46,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Michelle
B7mmfQA4Vf8UG5MaygGdZA,"Meh. Server had no suggestions for food and wine paring... ""all our wine goes with the food""... small plates bread heavy, I think we were served a whole loaf of crusty bread by the time we were done. It started raining on us and no one offered to move us inside. Disappointed. Won't be back.",OPYO5szacV-X7wEd6t0b9w,2021-07-03 21:53:18,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,2,Joyce
TEaNMVCV_UCqlDErklWf4g,"Wonderful new place in CBD. Reminds me of wine bars in New York and Chicago. So much wooden space and wonderful service. They have food options for the snackers like me and for my friends who ate full meals of rabbit, chicken and frog legs. There is something for every wine drinker because there's a 500 bottle list as well as an extensive list for wines by the glass.  I enjoyed trying their mystery wine of the day by the glass. I highly recommend this place for a classy night with the girls.",TjCS-ZDDpgp38DNKv6bhJA,2022-01-13 03:44:48,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Danielle

HvNjC4WaimyghSB-89CuLg,Small wine bar with a wide selection of wine and casual but chic atmosphere! The interior aesthetic is modern but relaxed. You can roll in wearing scrubs work clothes business casual or leggings. Lots of wine options for reasonable prices and the list is extensive! I could have sat there all night tasting them all. We got the goat cheese bread bites and they were the perfect accent to go with our Scandinavian orange wine! Counting down the days till I go back to pluck great service and beautiful dining experience,6xdI0JQ68vX0o5PTiuD1bg,2021-04-09 17:30:41,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Bella
7-owe4ml6ScaycseRApnIQ,Pluck wines is an nice upscale place to go with a small group of friends to sip tasty wines. I would recommend you come but eat before! The server was very knowledgeable about the wine selection.,ntptt8D6-mOITPB_hp10Yw,2021-09-24 14:18:45,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Cam
ZaS3LLPc3OawN2mdCqK3YQ,Last night was my first time at Pluck. We chose to celebrate a friend's birthday here and am so glad we did. The wine list by the bottle is extensive. Most of their wines are very well priced and they carry a wide selection in every price range. We ordered the Traboules (enjoyed it immensely) and then we happily took recommendations on what to follow it up with. The servers have extensive wine knowledge and our group was happy with everything they suggested. Ambiance is spot on.We didn't order much food aside from the charcuterie and croquettes. Both were great but paled in comparison to the wine (which is supposed to be the star of the show here). We did all forget to eat the birthday cake we brought...which only can mean that the servers are incredibly attentive and our glasses were never empty.,mzbxVF6u8LH8wnwUWGeAbQ,2021-11-17 16:20:02,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,4,Madison
n_UPoJHxvREhzgDQz-uDEg,I came for the Chilean Chardonnay. Such a cute new wine bar in CBD. Love the music. Great outdoor area and open space.,Er_1k4cl0VwKz9tfIn-FBw,2021-03-27 01:03:18,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,5,Lynn
oGs-g7GSw3BUlNFOCDaGGA,Pluck is located in the warehouse district and feels bright and new.  It is a wine bar but my experience with the food was equally as good.  The ham sandwich which has a much more elegant name was delightfully crunchy on the outside and soft and flavorful inside.  Staff were very pleasant and accommodating in this handsomely designed venue.  It is a great place for a lunch snack and of course a flight of wine.,Q54pSTc_cLNkMD0YBrkKPA,2021-11-27 02:45:18,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,4,James
6uF2UirDwebaneXdEIHvGw,"Stumbled upon this intimate cool vibe wine bar walking during the day and bookmark to try it at night.  The decor is modern and feels like a NYC spot. The wine list is curated with boutique wines and they also have a fun food menu that offers unique dishes. The staff is all very nice and they all work together as a team to serve the customers. My favorite food items on the menu were the :SMOKED YELLOWFIN TUNA SPREAD ON CROSTINI, $11 * excellent tasting Country Ham; House-Cured- on the charcuterie plate JAMBON BEURRE, $12 House-made picklesI was very impressed with the baguette they use for there gourmet sandwiches. It's pairs great with the wine. They ran out of a few main dishes so we didn't get to try any main plates.I would highly recommend this spot for a wine date or if you love wine.",xQ72nFYFH88I3S4_usobcA,2021-11-14 17:44:24,JVDkpFxbc_j49Wvxk5CtVA,4,Mira
