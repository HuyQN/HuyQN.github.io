v1qSUntOkIM33UA864aw4A,"In my quest to eat at every crab place in the vicinity, Happy Crab popped up on my social media. After tracking down their menu online, I called and placed my order. The guy was efficient on the phone, and told me 10 minutes. The restaurant is located in a strip mall, so there was plenty of parking. Inside it looks just like a takeout only place with plexiglassed front counter, and a couple of tables. My order was ready when I arrived so I was home eating 10 minutes later. They do their boils like another local place: the crab, potatoes, and corn were all served in a bag with the sauce. I chose 'Happy Crab Cajun' sauce  I went with mild, but it could have used more heat, so medium next time. The flavor was good, and the crabs, corn, and potatoes were all cooked well, however the main issue I had was that the crabs were cold. So, I think they need to work on their cooking times more. Because the crabs weren't even warm-they were maybe a step or two from frozen. The hush puppies were good though, and I saw an order of fries go out that looked amazing. Once they get this cold crab glitch worked out, the food could easily be 5 stars, and I'll definitely be back.",Wjia69bHEb7xeWMlxWNPGA,2021-03-06 18:59:31,Z4o3FbBeRjyvYzIvQ2Z_jg,4,Karen

This week was our first time at this restaurant, and we were glad we were in the area and stopped for take out. The male employee was really nice, and very attentive. We ordered shrimp and crab boil. I ate some, but my husband and oldest son really loved the food. We also ordered catfish well done with lemon pepper seasoning. They have lunch specials, but it was after 3:00, so we had missed it since it was about 4:30. If we are in the area again, we will take out again.",kQgmjLksME7DbDlP9SpInA,2021-08-20 02:57:30,Z4o3FbBeRjyvYzIvQ2Z_jg,4,Reen

eqls9zM8cUo5QJC7jX865Q,"This place is great for the price, (if you know much much it usually is to buy it and bring it home to cook for yourself). This place has the best seasonings, I would definitely suggest the happy crab special seasoning. Seafood is fresh, and if you have kids who aren't into seafood yet, they have a really good selection of fried shrimp, french fries, chicken wings, etc.",iDiILCepd62OSph3qVOPHw,2021-08-01 17:18:03,Z4o3FbBeRjyvYzIvQ2Z_jg,5,Yuki
W3fwWOhEiIK0lXbTTwEkrw,"TL;DR: Decent seafood, great service! 4/5 ratingIt's crawfish season, so this is a great time to discover some seafood restaurants in Tampa! My journey led me to a spot on Hillsborough Ave that opened not too long ago in Happy Crab. It is a small place next to a Wingstop. The interior was clean, and there was plexiglass up at the register as a covid-19 protocol. It's nice to see a place that has that extra level of protection. I was able to capitalize on a 10% off promotion, and the cashier was friendly and helpful. I went with a variety of seafood, including shrimp, green mussels, clams, crawfish, and blue crabs. I asked for all-female blue crabs, and they were able to accommodate my request. They have all the usual suspects with the flavoring, from the different spice levels to the garlic butter and the lemon pepper. I went with their mild version of their house sauce, which combines their mild, lemon pepper, and garlic flavor. Taste-wise, the sauce was delicious. It wasn't mind-blowing, but it got the job done. The pricing was what you would expect at a seafood restaurant here, and their service makes them stand out to me. I don't know if dine-in is an option because I only saw two tables at the moment, so do keep that in mind when you visit. All in all, they get a solid 4 out of 5 from me.",TwoySZgw93uN6VcXJD5iJA,2021-03-30 21:09:34,Z4o3FbBeRjyvYzIvQ2Z_jg,4,Jermaine
