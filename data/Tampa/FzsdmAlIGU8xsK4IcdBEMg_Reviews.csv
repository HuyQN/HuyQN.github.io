_Gz5QW46p5E1aL-PFDVS6g,"I LOVE this restaurant, it was my first time going to this establishment and I am happy my sister recommended it. I love this beautiful peaceful yet modern Japanese cafe. First Akemi and the other gentleman (I did not get his name) were truly welcoming to me. I felt comfortable and cared for here. I was her for just 10 minutes but that 10 minutes was not a wasted 10 minutes. It was a rainy day and after I received my food and drink I was about to leave than. Outside started to rain and I waited outside at the door ready to run to my car! But Akemi came to me with her umbrella and helped me to my car with was across the street. Not imagine downtown Tampa parked across the street with traffic and now raining lol SMH!! But I was shocked I will recommend this establishment to anyone that wants Japanese food!! The only CON I would have to mention is the parking. There is a pay by plate across the street in a parking yard but they charge $11.00 for the 0-6 hours parking time. You cannot get a time only for 30 minutes or less. But I did find a parking spot on the street corner for $2.50 per hour which was much more reasonable. So as I sit her writing this review and eating my Tuna Mayo Onigiri and drinking my Cold green tea I am truly happy with my service here and I will be back!!!",NennMv2IJKyRwryyhG2LJQ,2021-10-29 19:03:41,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,Ash

zEq5c1U4XgN11pDfvXHHJQ,"Junmai Station is a new Japanese takeaway spot in downtown Tampa at the bottom of the new Hyatt Place/Hyatt House. It is by the same duo that runs Ebisu Sushi Shack, so I expected good things. I wasn't disappointed! This eatery specializes in onigiri, which are scrumptious rice balls that are often in triangular shape and have various fillings. For my first visit, I got the shake (salted salmon $3.95) , shiso ume (shiso leaf & plum $3.50), tsukune (chicken meatball $4.25), and the rainbow (which is a whole plethora of ingredients $5.25). The shake and shiso ume were absolutely perfect! They were warm, delicious explosions of flavor in my mouth that were somehow so comforting. The shiso ume in particular, while the flavors were unfamiliar, was a real treat. Definitely try this one out if they have it! A selection of donburi (rice bowls) are also available, so I will try one of those next time. They only have a few seats at the window, so it's primarily a grab-and-go kind of place. I think this is a great addition to the downtown area!",HMgps_zOvwidoYJIrf22jA,2021-08-04 20:19:30,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,Arlene

j2a_CQncndchPsmS1f4GJA,My middle school aged kids were dying to try this restaurant because they watch a lot of anime on Netflix and they are always eating Onigiri. I have to say this place didn't disappoint.  We tried lots of flavor and the gyoza.  All fresh and delicious. We will be back soon.,lggAAN4kp-7yJ05SzIWK_A,2021-10-04 17:37:38,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,Aydin
gvTvbmrpJQE8VcYGmITQtQ,"Cute little place in downtown Tampa to grab a quick bite. I ordered the Shake and the beef curry bowl. The rice bowl came with miso soup. The food was ready within a few minutes (I'm assuming the beef curry is kept in a slow cooker in the back) and packaged well for taking home. I was given two napkins and a fork and spoon (no chopsticks, not sure why I wasn't offered). The Shake was very good. The salmon was nicely seasoned, as was the rice. They use the same fancy plastic wrapping that Noble Market uses/used to keep the seaweed crisp until you are ready to eat. Follow the numbered pulls to extricate the seaweed. The bowl was okay. It was heavy on the rice and curry sauce, light on the beef. They included pickles with it, and I found the pickles a little sweeter than I'd like (I like the really sour Japanese pickles or pickled ginger when I eat Japanese curry). No veggies with the bowl, and only the faintest traces of onion in the curry. I would have liked some potato or carrot.The proprietor said that they are working on new items including a chicken teriyaki burger in a rice bun. If it's anything like the rice bun snacks I've had in Asia, I'm intrigued.The location is on Kennedy at Florida. There's street parking, although you'll have to cross the street to get to the nearest pay machine.",vffKQc_WQMYFGY4JS5VAOw,2021-08-25 16:25:19,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,michelle
moeREIcd6Z8NNBt7q5L5gg,"One of the best finds of the year ! I have been trying to find an onigiri place since moving from nyc and Tampa was finally blessed with one right on Kennedy. Make sure you drive up Kennedy you won't be able to miss it!It's a small store front but the options of onigiri  pack a punch.If you don't know what onigiri is it is a rice ball filled with meat (they have vegetarian sour plum and rainbow, chicken meatball, teriyaki glazed salmon, tuna Mayo, miso hamburger, beef, shrimp tempura kani salad, baked salmon ) oh the options and they even have mochi  and other traditional lunch options including don buri bowls soup and seaweed salad! They can make them for you if they run out! Which they do because I'm yum?! The owner is very nice and super helpful with explaining the options.I would highly recommend and I totally will be back to this one of a kind place in Tampa.Probably one of my favorite finds this year!",d-UnWjdp567MVvCyREcovQ,2021-10-05 17:35:51,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,Nicole

The onigiris are all so tasty! And the Buta Don (pork belly and rice bowl) came with miso soup was very filling but not heavy. Perfect for lunch! If you're around the area, during the week day, at lunch time, you have to come by, I promise you won't be disappointed.",-6YHxNhkE2hcT-YGVqjI0Q,2022-01-10 00:53:24,FzsdmAlIGU8xsK4IcdBEMg,5,Jo
