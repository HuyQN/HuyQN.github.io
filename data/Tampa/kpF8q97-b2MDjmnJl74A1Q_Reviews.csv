jzmVlGOGDbHR6ADKP5BDHg,"This fun eatery near USF neighborhood, provides authentic grab and go Korean food, drink and snacks. Delicious, convenient, and affordable is what I like about this place. My top favorite are the Bulgoki beef lunch box and fish cake soup. The box got rice, slice beef, dumpling, kimchi and others. It was so good I don't mind have it for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The broth of the soup was tasty ( better drink it when warm) and the different shape of fish cake got wonderful texture and flavor. There was one row of table and chairs for dine in. The microwave oven was presented for reheating the food. The employee were helpful and courteous. I will try the kimbap and dessert in the future.",6DR4LS9hxlGcPYVho-FOQQ,2021-10-20 03:03:07,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Grace

Come to find out that it's also a Sa Ri One concept/deli? Super cool -- I must go in and check out the other items they have to offer after my family and I were so very satisfied with our delivery order.Anywho, the lunch box they offer is so great. Great price, great portions, great selection and most importantly, great flavor. Highly recommend checking this place out.",PvRv4AGT6ySfpnnvu185oA,2022-01-02 21:06:39,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Samantha

It had a perfect balance of fresh ingredients.",Tg_TwTm_aSnIQXkxXuOiWA,2021-09-18 19:34:05,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Jordan
xEeNyQjmhrHU5H3cgyqCew,"Stopped here on my way home from work. Being Korean, this is a perfect place to stop by if I'm feeling lazy to cook and want to grab some quick Korean food to-go for dinner! They have kimbap, tteobokki, pre packaged lunch boxes, bibimbap, kimchi, Korean pastries and more. Ordered 3 types of kimbap: bulgoki beef, chicken mayo (FAV), and kimchi flavors. They make it right there in front of you so it's super fresh. Great portion sizes. Also bought some kimchi which tasted pretty good. Definitely going back to try some of the other items on their menu!",Clj2_RXEguq_oudRFyVvZQ,2021-09-01 22:18:21,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Kat
d2geJYFsqMLJLYks6kNA2Q,"May be it is still new store, all qualities of the food are good. Hopefully they will keep it up. We like lunch box. They do have other selections in the menu such as Kimbob and bibimbob. We got bulgogi chicken and beef lunch box. The side dish is changed on different visit. We saw side like chicken nuggets, seaweed salad, slice scrambled egg, fried whole egg, imitation crab meat, goyoza, kimchi, and more. The bulgogi spicy chicken and beef is good. I like the beef better. One other thing is the fish cake soup. My wife like this item. If you eat it immediately, it is delicious. If you left overnight, the fish cake is a bit soggy. Definitely is to eat at the same time you order.",fr1Hz2acAb3OaL3l6DyKNg,2021-10-28 13:56:51,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,4,Boon
k9Fnuy7GkIIPhbjzNK0Opg,Delicious food. Great price and large portions. My new go to lunch spot. The parking lot is kinda small. There is some space to sit inside and microwaves for you to warm up a lunchbox if you want to stay and enjoy your food. Their cucumber kimchi is delicious! I will definitely be coming back again and again!,4HIsf73zmjTWlAVPUNb5kg,2021-10-08 02:40:16,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Alexa
FW1BLm4gB1ea4HAXLcOi4A,"I was just delighted to see another interesting food concept come to this area of town. I'm going to fully disclose that some of this review is based on photos other people have posted. I only got delivery from them. It was actually hard doing research for this place. The photos of the sign outside and the digital signs inside show it's another Sa Ri One location. But their website (www.usfkdeli.com) says the name is K-Deli. K-Deli is what I found them under with my delivery service.Apparently this is a grab and go place with limited seating. I got a boxed lunch and thought it was a great value. In the photos these are sitting out on a display table for people to grab quickly. This actually confuses me a little because there's a small window for how long you can leave cooked food at room temperatures, but I'm sure they've thought of that. I can see why some people who were expecting a full restaurant would be put off if they came in and saw minuscule seating and a microwave but I think it's brilliant. This is directly across the street from a college and it's perfect for people that just want to grab a quick lunch between classes or on the way to work.I actually think their website is doing them a disservice concerning their boxed meals. The description just says ""Spicy Chicken"" for my box lunch when you get so much more. Since there's no description I'm going to do my best to list the contents: clear noodles, kimchi, two vegetarian (?) sushi rolls, purple sticky rice (very good), chicken, what I'm guessing is thinly sliced tofu, and what seemed like a small fried spring roll (?) that I quite enjoyed.Unfortunately, my problem is that I just can't handle spicy food and at least half of the things in my box were spicy. I knew that going in but wanted to try it anyway.  For people that like their spice this is a great addition to the USF area.",lnohBN_e2qklLESYih9Mvw,2021-11-22 16:10:02,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,4,Chris
jSlzpzfMinTyt7v3oHDxJw,"I was craving for some Korean food and decided to go try Sari One's new deli. They're located right next to cookie munchers and across from Staples. They have drinks and banchan dishes already available for purchase and we went to order. I've been looking for good bulgogi kimbibap and I've finally found it! It was so big and delicious! Staff greeted us when we walked in and we're very nice. They also have noodles, water for your noodles, and a microwave for use as well as a dining area. It was very clean and sleek in there. I would definitely go again! We went around 6pm and they were out of lunch bento boxes so it made sense. Go earlier if you want to get a lunch box!",JmN0ZSfVzwiY1dBhKF9Uxg,2021-11-09 16:18:40,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Melissa
wIarjtyu0NsJe84AMLd6hg,"This Korean grab and go style deli takes me back to my days in NYC Koreatown where I was a frequent shopper at Woorijip. In this small space, you can find pre-packed lunch bulgogi sets ($12) and side dishes to sweet baked buns ($2-5) and various kimbap prepared to order ($14). They even have a small selection of Korean groceries and make homemade Korean rice punch. I was most delighted to find all my favorite, hard to find banchan dishes here like seasoned dried shredded squid, stir fried anchovies, and stir fried black beans. Prices for banchan vary greatly based on item and size. I found the prices here to be a bit steep, however there is a lack of availability of similar concepts so I will definitely return to stock up on banchan and for an occasional quick meal. They have a few tables inside as well as a microwave available for customers if you want to heat up your prepackaged bulgogi set and eat it there.",-2Vg22LqKpg0zjf5A-SWLA,2021-09-17 21:51:21,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,4,Ren
vQpKj9WFXCfmZHoPa9p8Bw,"I've eaten at many Sa Ri One locations over the years. I saw this pop up by my work so I headed over with two colleagues to give it a try. I had the vegetable bibimbap without mushrooms. I loved the spicy sauce on the side. It's served cold which is a first for me. I've had warm bowls before with rice. This had the standard veggies and noodles. I enjoyed it. My friend liked her beef bulgogi. It was also cold and premade in the fridge. You can microwave it to warm it up. She liked the flavor of it. I wish it wasn't in a plastic container as that's unsafe to microwave or they'd coffee a different container for dine in. We also tried the fish patty, spicy soup. It was so delicious! I've never had that before. My other friend had a sushi roll. It was OK. It's a bummer that artificial crab is used it all of them. I'd pay up for real crab meat.  I bought some dumplings with pork for my sons. I find it interesting how there are premade dumplings, breads, crab cakes, etc available for sale. It's in front of you and irresistible. You need to buy something new! It again is cold so you'd need to warm it up there or at home. I tried a pear juice from their beverage section that was good. Many people came in for take out. We were the only three people dining in. There are about 10 or stools in side. The workers were very nice. Very limited menu, but nice addition to the USF area.",7PIZ6uiK5eztf3Deoqihfw,2021-10-02 14:47:49,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,4,K
VwbjJcIsK6v6bLXnFyvymg,"Quaint and contemporary Korean deli with some quick food fixes and assorted traditional Korean drinks and side dishes like kimchee.  You can order online, but we happened to be at the location so we walked in and got some fried Korean egg pancakes, buchingae, and some bulgogi beef kimbop, think sushi rolls.Will have to come back to try some of the drinks, but I was carb'ed out for the day, which gives me an excuse to coke back.  Lunch menu is small, but will do the trick so hopefully the food is as good as it smells!",qQkGAvvHqxpGn4ejf4dQKw,2021-08-16 23:55:51,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,David
PP1CTMvLQvGpEOwtrG6-QA,Read about them opening on Facebook and couldn't believe they were located right next door to Cookie Munchers. Since we were already there for a cookie we just had to go over and check this new location out!! Love Sa Ri One on Hillsborough Ave and Cypress so this is exciting to have a fast take out type setting. They do have some seating available in a bar like setting along the wall. They have refrigerators setup in the back with cold food items like kimchi and other Korean side dishes. In the center they have other specialties like the pork and red bean buns and egg pancakes. They also have freshly made Korean food that you can order and wait for. We ordered the Bulgogi Kim bop (Bulgogi sushi). Sooooo good!!! Comes with a spicy Mayo and soy sauce for dipping. We devoured this!!  We will definitely be back in for some more yumminess!!! Come check this place out. Located next to Cookie Munchers with is in the Panera Bread plaza.,Sp2GV7D-_JLZMPQmDanzPQ,2021-08-21 12:01:20,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Brigitte
zpkCA7GyecV5K5jr8MUhAQ,"This place is great and I love the concept. It's reasonably priced and given you a diverse selection of food which is an overall healthier choice for lunch that will still fill you up. We got the tteokboki,  a bulgolgi kimbap, and mandu. everything was very good, the kimbap was stuffed with filling and flavor and service was quick. Next time I go I am going to get there lunch plate to try it. Very great choice for lunch in the area",4wN4iM2Wirf6cLRWduKsDg,2021-09-02 13:46:13,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Joseph
aHRcVD_EeCZYcRAJTOsdBw,Came in here a while back during their first opening week but haven't had a chance to review. After reading all these 5 stars ratings I had to go back in and give you my own insight. Great concept - ok location and friendly customer service. Definitely not my vibe or cup of latte. Over priced & not worthy for what it is. I have been to both other Sa Ri One restaurant and those are ok. I personally don't like. To me it's basically a shop to grab food and microwave it! If that's the case - NO thanks I'll stay home. 1 star for overall experience for me. 1 star for lack of selections & totally disappointed for sure.If you do decide to check them out.. the food is just ok.,JRnJvyx_FpvWMWWKic8arg,2021-09-18 14:10:13,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,1,Vivian
KIhVzb-wnG7Cz6W8_Hfz9A,"We stopped at this place to get lunch before hitting the road. We ordered 3 kinds of gimbap: cheese, spam and bulgogi beef. They were all very tasty and perfect for a lunch on the go! We wanted to try their lunch boxes but since we were driving we're just going to have to come  back next time! They also have a selection of pastries and Korean groceries. They even have an assortment of house made kimchis. Definitely a good spot for quick and affordable Korean food!",-6YHxNhkE2hcT-YGVqjI0Q,2022-01-02 16:36:44,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Jo

mC_dAs68hPp2cfo-4ujJ1w,"This new business did a good job of grabbing my attention by placing tons of signs around their business, forcing me to get HAAAANGRY (in a good way)Very pleasing atmosphere from the moment that I walked inside and I was immediately warmly greeted and welcomed.  They had lots of quick grab items that were already prepared as well as a large selection of local and imported beverages.Their menu was simple and easy to understand, even if you are not familiar with Korean food.  It's primarily 2 items with your choice of which proteins go inside 1) Kimbob, which is basically Korean sushi and 2) Bibimbob, which is a deconstructed version of the Kimbob.Choices on the Kimbob range from Bulgoki Beef, Chcken, Tuna, Kimchi, Egg or Vegetable.  Bibmimbob is either Bulgoki Beef, Vegetable or Ground BeefI went with the Bulgoki Beef and it was MASISSEOYO.  (That's Korean for delicious)  The meat was perfectly cooked and oh so flavorful and the vegetables were super fresh and wonderfully combined.  When I thought that this couldn't get any better, I noticed a spicy mayo dipping sauce that they included and decided, ""Why not?!??""  And I was so glad that I did, I liked varying a dipped bite with a non dipped bite.  It really added a whole nother layer of complexity and AWESOMENESS to this Kimbob.Then, as I often like to do, I asked the person helping me what her FAVORITE dish was and she said Tteok Bok Ki.  I had never heard of this before, nor could I have spelled it correctly for this review if it wasn't written out on my receipt... but once she said it was spicy... I WAS DOWN for some Tteok Bok Ki.Basically it is thick rice noodles in a red, spicy sauce accompanied with a boiled egg that has marinated in the same yummy sauce.  It was spicy but not TOO spicy.  Just a lovely warmth and infinitely eatable... is that a word?!?!?  I'm saying it is.NOTE: this dish did not perform well as a leftover when cooked in the microwave.  Definitely recommend eating this all fresh in one sitting and/or sharing it with a friend or two... it's a big serving as side dishes go.Also got a lesson on the name of this place, apparently it is named after the town where the owner's family is from in North Korea... Sa Ri One.Other interesting item to note... This is the third Sa Ri One restaurant location in Tampa.  Their main restaurant is on Cypress Street just off Interstate-275, and they have another one in Town 'n Country.  This location is considered a fast-casual deli style version of their other restaurants.  I am not sure what all of these hipster names really mean, but I know that the food is very good and that, in the immortal words of Arnold Schwarzenegger, ""I'll be back...""",P5F6tfuzk9HgwC5ZqfbjQg,2021-08-23 00:15:47,kpF8q97-b2MDjmnJl74A1Q,5,Keith
