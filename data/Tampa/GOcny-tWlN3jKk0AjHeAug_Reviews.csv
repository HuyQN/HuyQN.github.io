RTDjYDkKpep0tRiav2lRaA,"So good to see a new local alternative to Stonewood although it's a bit of a drive (from Tampa Palms).  Second time here.  On both times the service is great and they have a great wine list.  Mike the bartender is very helpful.   The staff seems very involved and happy which is great to see these days.Pricy but portions are ample, and what's not pricy these days?  Decor...they're doing their best given the size.  Maybe a divider between the bar area and tables.  They do play appropriate music at the right volume.Food?  Grilled shrimp perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Polenta cake dry and tasteless.  Chicken Tschoplous tough and bland.  Mushroom hash delicious.   It's a work in progress and I'll probably update this as I come back for more.Overall I plan on being a regular here when i want a break from Tampa Palms.  The area needs it.",kSlFIcuZb0SQJPXVHsabGA,2022-01-15 22:57:38,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,4,Samantha
5R8mTv-BvKpZ485PgBdVRg,So we took our chances and tried this restaurant without reservations. We ended up sitting at the bar which we like to do anyways but you could tell they really cared to try to get us a table if we wanted one. We had the pizza for an appetizer and it was great to share. It was very tasty and heated up well the next day. I had the Kale and Mushroom risotto which was great until I tried my husband's chicken and broccolini which was FABULOUS!,qnBYAGvVWDc3ldTDNfT4ow,2022-01-12 23:53:58,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,5,Ashley
wXFTZpyQI_P0WH-M36HU0Q,"Our first visit to this new local restaurant and we were all very impressed. Our party of 4 --without reservations--showed up on a Friday night at prime dinner time and were able to sit immediately at the bar. The place was packed so we were happy to be accommodated at our preference. Craft cocktails were on point! We sampled the Fruity & lemonade, High West Old Fashioned, Cali-Fashion, and the Paper Plane. Each of them were excellent...but for $7 the Cali-Fashion is phenomenal. I hope this signature drink never changes including the happy hour price! On the menu we sampled the Charcuterie Board, Black Grouper, Mushroom & Kale Risotto, Wild Mushroom Tomato, and a pizza from the bar menu. Everything was delicious, large portions, so much flavor-basically something fir everyone with a foodie palate. That said there is a kids menu we didn't sample-but its there. Huge wine menu...What this place might lack in atmosphere/view, it makes up for in quality menu items, well appointed bar, friendly staff, and motivated staff and management. Give it a shot  you won't be disappointed.",1XnTPifVntQ-Ollp48YCQw,2022-01-08 02:36:20,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,5,Jessica
SCQjfILhSr7Z88zKIrDQhA,"Had dinner here last night after hearing rave reviews on Next Door. They were not wrong! We were seated promptly after arriving around 6pm. Most people coming in had reservations. It's not a large restaurant, so I would definitely recommend reservations. There was plenty of seating at the bar though. They have an impressive wine selection and a full bar. Our waiter, Luigi, was friendly and prompt with service. We ordered the crab cake appetizer, which was AMAZING!  For entrees, I had the filet mignon and hubby had the black grouper. Both were superb. My steak was served with au gratin potatoes and grilled asparagus. The sauce on the steak was very tasty as well. Hubbys grouper was fresh and cooked perfectly, served with polenta and broccoli. We also split a side of mac and cheese, which was very tasty! I loved how other severs and manager all pitched in to provide stellar service! It's a little pricey, but they do have a ""bar menu"" with some less expensive options. All in all, a flawless experience and we will be back!",gSrcSoLrbA9bVmS7OTI1LA,2022-01-16 12:37:01,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,5,Donna
axWlZLGeMJU74rLxOcRlMQ,"We came with 6 of us, ages 8-75. The service was amazing. We were even greeted by the bartender to make sure our drinks were good and asked if we wanted more. Our server was so so informative and if she didn't know, made sure to ask the chef what was included in the ingredients as we have some food allergies. (Dairy and gluten) Wow. Just wow. So flavorful and delicious. Even the kids Mac n Cheese was delicious! If you are in the area, you need to add this to your stop. Clean and friendly and good food.",d-N2iUjUEQqWyDKHNj-iIQ,2022-01-05 00:53:55,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,5,Mary

SszGHZ6xIf0P413-i50Uxg,Pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and ambiance. The staff was courteous and knowledgeable and the food was excellent . The kids loved the calamari and I enjoyed the grouper which was cooked perfectly. The potatoes au gratin was the best I ever had! Excellent wine selection too! I will be back,5mRFnOvXYghzkeaWiJ0sjQ,2022-01-15 01:32:02,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,4,Phil
ThJAypzKkfgRaIqy9UT5qA,"Neighbor made a recommendation so we popped in for dinner. Delicious food and nice, quaint setting made for an enjoyable meal. The music was a bit loud, and if you're looking for a roomy seat, avoid the booths next to the back wall. Super excited to have a nice place close to home! Salmon was very good and I've never had creamier polenta!  Grand opening is Jan 11th so stop in before things get super busy!",qfcAXBCpJU31Jvri91XmSA,2022-01-02 16:43:15,GOcny-tWlN3jKk0AjHeAug,4,A
