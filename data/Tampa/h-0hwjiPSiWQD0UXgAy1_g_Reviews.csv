YnAgXR7Mj64jZN5KXHLEgg,"Delicious lunch today! The customer service and food were both top notch. The staff was running around checking on everyone. They even filled the water cups at our table, pulled up a high chair for my daughter, and carried our food over for us. Super nice! The food was so fresh, flavorful, and healthy. I was left full but no gross bloated feeling or sugar crash. They also gave our whole party little sample cups of the dole whip - it was very refreshing and not overly sugary. They have fish and non-fish options (chicken, spam) and vegetarian friendly (tofu). There really is something for everyone here! I'm excited to have them in the area.",TEabXFyQct_t955jWwycTw,2021-05-27 19:04:31,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Caroline
KyiHYCDwpd6ERdcAbIdz4g,"Great new option! The staff walked me through my first time, explaining all the toppings and sauces, and what cost extra for add ons. Portions were very generous for a $12 bowl- much better than I've seen at other poke style places, 3 proteins included. Didn't get a dole, but at the end they offered me a sample and I can see that being worth it too. Looking forward to next trip.",uuW41izwL5noXaqiAb1x0A,2021-06-19 19:14:52,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Brit
VXAdRqYbrIR6nyxT_1Zsrw,I was excited for this place to open and they did not disappoint. The employees walked me through every single menu item and described the flavors and process of making the veggies and sauces. The portion size was perfect. The bowl was delicious!! Will definitely be coming back here all of the time,NP_rhLtjjZtfkRRWRqgiHg,2021-06-10 14:05:23,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Val

z_Y8M9_CF6RfRq9x1tsXWQ,This place was bussinnn. the dude who helped me create my bowl was super nice and knowledgeable. Definitely not what I expected it was like super packed w toppings n protein.

crEPWsZ6a4NcgU1Y-4xIBw,"I was very impressed with Island Fin Poke on our first visit today. The owner was very friendly and the entire staff was very helpful. Unlike other poke places, the ordering experience was unique as it was a build your own line. The dole whip was icing on the top. Not only will we be back for poke, we might need to make special stops for just the dole whips.",jEuhPX0F3GTX0QlYzVt9Iw,2021-06-27 01:16:46,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,John

Dd9OgHSn9CYINQUF4-up9Q,"Super happy with the poke bowls we got for the price. We'll be back. We debated making what we had in the house, which would have been tuna fish and a salad. But went for assembling our own bowls for $12. Well....I spent the extra dollar to add avocado. Worth it to me at $13 for my bowl. AND I could assemble the bowls online and schedule an advance pickup, which I did. You could also go into the shop and tell them what you want as they fix it, kind of like Subway, but with poke bowl ingredients.The ingredients were fresh and we both thought it was enough for a quick, refreshing, cold dinner on a hot summer day. We each chose a different long list of free add ons and sauces and were not disappointed with any of it. They did give more cucumber and not enough pickled radish in my opinion, so be mindful that there may not be completely equivalent portions of all your add ons. They give you three scoops of proteins for that $12 and we mixed ours up, just a bit, with spicy tuna and ahi tuna. Again, pleased with what we got for the price.This is NOT fine sushi -- and why the four stars. The fish itself was not Soho Sushi grade. But it was as delicious as ""fast food"" raw tuna will be. This is more personally chosen ingredients than a fresh Publix sushi. If you don't like that grade of tuna, then pick another protein or choose another place.The store itself seemed clean and fresh as any new restaurant -- Hawaii road side stand meets Florida strip mall. The people working behind the counter were polite, which is easy, but doesn't always happen, when you're empty and not dealing with a meal time rush. So, plus one for them. Posting this review so they stick around. Very nice alternative to have in the area.",59dFHR26bsPqJMXIE7FG1Q,2021-07-28 13:01:06,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,4,Randi
ySus8SV7at7SuikZ43nYtA,"Very tasty with friendly and helpful staff!  If you're looking for a healthier option for dinner you don't have to cook, head over to Island Fin Poke. They have  so many delicious options to help you create your own perfect poke bowl. I went with the triple scoop of spicy tuna with a 1/2 & 1/2 base of rice and greens, topped with all of the spicy veggies and sauces. The fiancé chose spicy tuna, regular tuna and salmon. We both really enjoyed our meals and will be back. Great addition to the Carrollwood area",KrUd3js8E5bVeMAzkiWWFQ,2021-07-24 21:07:26,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,4,Elena

06XT041Ub_Zf9uoN8XyeqQ,I have been a fan of Poke for years. Best Poke I ever had was in Hawaii and always looking for new local place. This place opened not too far from home and was excited to see that they finally opened. I have been here twice now and overall I like the place. The staff is great and explain the options and how it works.,BmZ0Xngq4fFGrGaK1SxjWg,2021-07-20 18:03:53,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,4,Evan

Nzp5tbCgFIW-bDQGnT0k1Q,Favorite poke bowl place. Customer service was amazing. Loved whoever helped us here! Brown hair man bun and tall. Helped us with all questions.

sU-6N3fUfpfKelVVxscIjw,"Stopped in for lunch today and walked out very impressed with every intention of coming back. First off, all of the staff were the NICEST people I think I've ever encountered in a quick service restaurant. They all took the time to explain the menu, offered suggestions, and checked on us multiple times to make sure our meal was good. And, holy moly, the meal was GOOD! All of the ingredients were extremely fresh and brightly colored, the flavors were amazing, and the portion size was perfect. If I could have licked the bowl, I would have. I have gone to many Poke bowl places and this one is by far the best!",-_oc7og-5i5vkVRIJCIrag,2021-10-19 20:18:26,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Stefanie

FUMLNdurcfWDn8XQgIAYag,"This is a great new addition to Carrollwood. The poke is fresh, the portions were generous, and there were many toppings to choose from.

We will definitely be back!",5fNz1-pIEMhvJq4ytCwvEw,2021-06-05 01:38:00,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Ashley
_Gga1cB4Zd3c4DgSqoAg_g,There's a good reason this place has all 5 stars. Great staff which is hard to find post-covid. Great quality which is hard to find at a poke place. Highly recommended. I usually avoid poke places because of the bad ones but this place makes it worth it and will definitely be back. It's a bit on the pricier side but the portion sizes and quality make it a good value.,ij1781qP6efk5qhedm9_Ig,2021-10-09 16:59:55,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,5,Eric
qnaOVXYqoZWXdEzu53vMqw,"Pros: * lots of parking. * friendly and knowledgeable staff * customizable poke bowls * so many options/toppings * 3 scoops of protein per bowl! * chili oil FTW! * fresh fruits like mango and pineapple salsa, Yumm. * complimentary dole whip sample. Sweet gesture. * most of their sauces have gluten free ingredients. Cons: * the spicy tuna and the octopus didn't have much taste. * None of the marinating sauce were soy free. * While you do get unlimited toppings and veggies, $12 for poke is overpriced.They're still new to the block, let's see what surprises they come up with next.",AXjHVxklbeyrZwcP4oge7A,2021-08-02 00:26:02,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,4,Robin

jRuolzG3Wj3Umm4NFHa2QA,"Why 4 stars? Because I'm excited to have another solid option in my neighborhood.   ---   ---   ---This space used to be operated by Freshii, which had a lot of potential but was such a disappointing product. After one visit, I can confidently say that we, the people of Carrollwood, just got an upgrade.I love poke and I love bowls. I also love Dole Whips. All of these things can be found at Island Fin Poke. My wife and I ordered online and she picked up the food and brought it home. I would have happily dined in, but I was on ""put the kid to sleep"" duty. Next time, I'll definitely visit in person myself.Fortunately, we only live a few minutes away, so we definitely enjoyed our food about as freshly as we would have if we'd dined in. I have to say that my bowl was solid - not among the best poke I've had, but certainly far from the worst. I ordered two scoops of regular poke and one scoop of spicy. I'm not sure if it was the spicy scoop or something else, but there was definitely a bit of kick somewhere!There are tons of options when building your own bowl - I really couldn't think of anything missing. Next time, I want to try some of the salmon and ceviche shrimp.We're excited to have another good spot so close by - especially one where you can eat fairly healthy if need be!",pou3BbKsIozfH50rxmnMew,2021-05-31 14:03:27,h-0hwjiPSiWQD0UXgAy1_g,4,Brett
