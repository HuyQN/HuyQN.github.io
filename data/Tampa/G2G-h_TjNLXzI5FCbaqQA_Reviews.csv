te90EIIMqql2HehhqhA03w,"Absolutely delicious! The place is clean and the staff is friendly. I ordered the lunch special and I am actually quite full after the soup, salad, and rolls. Their spicy rolls don't use globs of spicy mayo, but actually have a good flavor that complements the fish instead of overwhelming it. I just found my new favorite lunch spot!",ub0dkGMef5J7mHBKNc5TqQ,2021-12-15 17:38:44,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,5,Nina
K_qAF5bO0mmgRaPx9iJEYA,"Oishi Sushi & Thai of Oldsmar has moved into Tampa and is finally open for business!!!Conveniently located on W. Hillsborough Ave, in the new plaza next to Racetrac, nestled between Ocean Nails and Tropical Smoothie.This stylish new restaurant is run by the same awesome staff, still offering their classic sushi menu and some quintessential Thai dishes.  As always they are allergy friendly and are able to prepare most things Gluten Free by request! During my comeback visit, my friend and I shared edamame and ordered Bento Boxes, with Miso soups and salads. Bento Box 8 included crab stick salad, rainbow roll, three pieces of sushi and half a California roll. Everything tasted fresh, flavorful and was portioned perfectly for our hungry tummies. Oishi picked right back up where they left off.",fen9BWC39ul9SJZfQ-onpg,2021-11-05 23:55:19,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,5,Mel
l5ieFDq56fwIjnhTm2hhqA,"Best sushi place in the area.I'm a huge sushi eater. I've been lucky to experience good sushi in my life and Tampa has always been a bit of a disappointment to me. I've found that even though Oishi is a bit more expensive, it is better quality. Here are the rolls I've experienced recently.Albino Salmon: I find their salmon fresh so this is a favorite for me. It has cream cheese, which I always like to get one roll that has that. Fresh Salmon: If I get another roll with cream cheese then I switch the Albino Salmon to the Fresh Salmon. I've had mediocre salmon other places, so I'm happy that it's so good here.NTU: This used to be a favorite, but its dropped down on my list. I don't like the amount of mayo they use on it, so the second time we ordered I swapped this out for another option.Rainbow roll: It's good, but not great. I also swapped this out for something else when we ordered again.Red Dragon: I found this delicious. I get this with the Fresh Salmon roll, since this one has cream cheese. I'd get it again.Sashimi roll: This one is a little too healthy for me. I like my rolls with a little bit of umph, which is probably why I'm not getting the Rainbow Roll again, or this one.Sunny Salmon: My favorite roll by far. It's probably because the whole thing is fried. Definitely a must get for me.Super Protein: I always get the super protein as well. I like the tempura crunch and smelt roe on top.Tokyo Tower: This also had a bit too much mayo for me. I wouldn't get it again.Tuna Garlic: I liked it, but I didn't love it. I also swapped this out when I ordered a second time. I do like the garlic sauce though.This place is more expensive, but I also find their rolls to be bigger. I think a roll and a half would be enough for one person. My dad and I ordered five rolls plus tobiko nigiri and saba nigiri the first time and had so much sushi. I switched to four rolls plus the nigiri the second time and we still have leftover for my dinner (my dad had to fend for himself). This is my go-to spot for sushi now. I'm glad it's so close by!",-kLVfaJytOJY2-QdQoCcNQ,2021-12-14 19:13:17,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,5,Christina

ryXOtL6pMn_dRvyW8HPYGg,They are doing a great job from the new location.  Awesome rolls which are really big with great attention to detail.  The sashimi is fresh and a great thickness.  The staff is super kind and attentive but not overwhelming.  I'm so glad they're closer to us so we can go more often.  It's a must try,MuLOY0a693mnxiWsTZ6-0g,2021-12-30 02:27:11,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,5,Melissa
KnmL4HpGjxAKVG2m2JN_Ew,"Tried out this new sushi spot on Friday night and it was great! Pros: The staff was friendly, the sushi was AMAZING, prices were reasonable.Cons: it took almost an hour and a half for our sushi to come out. It looked like they only had 2 servers on a a Friday night and 1-2 ppl making sushi. I was not in a rush but did here a few people around me mentioning how long they were waiting. I would also suggest adding some artwork to the space :) I would definitely return :)",QHfyoCgVPic99BSwSzq-3A,2022-01-13 00:10:34,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,4,Craig

RttC-5v0_yxtYaD1Ed8Y9w,"Oishi moved from the Ross plaza in Oldsmar over to near the Racetrac on Hillsborough! This new location is absolutely beautiful and modern. Right next to Tropical Smoothie, this new location has plenty of parking and the ambiance is vibrant and they have a great calming playlist going! My family came for a Friday evening dinner and to drink we had the Kirin Light which was fairly priced. There was also a variety of other beers and wines offered! As well as sake! As for appetizers we started with the tempura oysters, 6 fresh oysters which were SO delicious (they weren't on the menu but the waitress recommended it and I do too!!). The fresh oysters had a sweet sauce on each with a variety of fish eggs which made the taste super unique compared to other fresh oysters I had! We also started our meal with ginger salads which came with a variety of veggies (more so than most sushi places!) and the dressing was perfectly sweet and tangy. For rolls we had eel and salmon nigiri, the Alaska roll, Florida roll, NTU roll, Spider roll, Super Crunchy roll and a handful of others! All were absolutely delicious. The specialty rolls came with a perfect amount of sauce and rice to fish ratio! They also gave plentiful ginger and wasabi. The ginger was perfect too and wasn't dry like some sushi spots. Overall absolutely love the new Oishi spot and will definitely be back!",gENQ4Uh3Adeg5tOEAfsW2A,2021-11-13 00:44:29,-G2G-h_TjNLXzI5FCbaqQA,5,Kim
