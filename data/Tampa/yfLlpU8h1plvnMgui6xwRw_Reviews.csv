_Q2-o1Sbc2BMMlMRFZYbSg,"I know people don't like exaggerated terms in reviews.  But we bought a pound of brisket from The Brisket Shoppe today to take home.  Hands down, the best I've ever had.  It had a great bark, with a beautiful smoke ring.  When you hold it in your fingers, it had the perfect ""bend"".  (Brisket cooks know what I'm talking about here). Danny, the owner, also gave us a sample of some brisket chili he had made this morning.  It was terrific!  We don't live close by......but it was well worth our drive from New Tampa to Armenia for this food!  Good people, making GREAT food.",ZTMi_J_qANrUvay5sCMkkg,2021-11-13 19:13:47,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Fran
UU7rGsTVvWwV7miiXudxhQ,"This place is amazing! The brisket is genuine Texas BBQ. The owner Dan really takes pride in what he does and it shows. Everything is the highest quality from the meat to the sides such as the pickles which are great. Also, the sausage links are the best I think may have ever had. I am fortunate to go Texas often and this BBQ would be popular there too. Awesome place open for lunch 3 days a week (thurs-sat). They also sell grills and even meat that you can cook yourself from snake River farms which is very cool!",45Bo2WbF4GbwUCDfXQMFEQ,2021-07-10 19:53:52,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Cash

24A58ARZbqcpiKYWRDV7gg,"This review is for their drive thru.The Brisket Shoppe serves up brisket and sausage for about half the week (they are closed for the first half of the week). They have outdoor seating, but I went through the drive thru. They also have curbside service if you call ahead.I tried a hot link, a jalapeno cheddar sausage and the coleslaw. They no longer have collard greens, although it shows up on their online menu (as of today).The food was nicely packed up. The sausages were both pretty good with a good snap to the casing. The coleslaw was unexpectedly good. It was largish chunks of cabbage and onion in a spicy, herbalicious vinaigrette. I would have preferred the veggies to be cut into smaller pieces, but the flavor was so good that my qualms were dismissed. This isn't fast food, so don't expect fast food prices or speeds, but the quality is good, and this place was worth the trip. I can't wait to return to try their brisket and ribs.",vffKQc_WQMYFGY4JS5VAOw,2021-06-17 19:05:34,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,michelle

czdYTLzi_OvxU7TapyuO9Q,"It was my husband and I's first time here and it won't be our last. Brisket is delicious and melts in your mouth. We also got each of the sides - beans, mac & cheese, cole slaw and potato wedges. They were fresh and tasty. Staff was also very friendly. We can't wait to go back!",_TzOmcLnREIincUMpM594Q,2021-08-07 19:58:47,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Kim
6bPHpaFEesomILk-b52BKA,"Brisket shoppe is open limited time only. Only Saturday they serve Dino Bone. Price is above average BBQ restaurants. However, they did use the good quality meat. We have the two different links of sausage and a few slice of brisket. The link sausage come with pickles cucumber, cube of cheese and slice of bread. This look like wine worthy dish. The brisket was slice with lean meat and slice edge fat. It is perfect. The seasoning is good. The meat is delicious due to slow hours BBQ. Overall the food is good. Seating only at the outside.",fr1Hz2acAb3OaL3l6DyKNg,2021-05-19 17:59:28,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,4,Boon
4S6DH2j_Pr2-VzTXQ_5low,"Excellent Brisket, possibly the best in Tampa right now. I picked up a pound of moist brisket, along with jalapeño cheddar sausages from the drive-thru. Brisket had an excellent bark and was super tender. Excellent smoky flavor although I found it a tad bit salty. About as close to genuine Texas brisket as you'll find anywhere in Florida. Jalapeño cheddar Sausages were fantastic as well. If you love brisket you must try this place.",Lk6k8rWZcF7r4qyO4NhnpQ,2021-04-30 17:09:51,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Manuel
RLnoAPG6SjzLlo6lyLw_NA,"Their food menu is rather small and limited in terms of the meats and sides they offer. Of course the brisket is the most important item on their menu but they also have pork ribs, jalapeño cheddar sausage and Texas hot links. As for sides, all they serve is mac & cheese and brisket & beans. We ordered half a slab of ribs and half a pound of brisket, both were served with sliced Wonder bread, pickles and pickled onions. This detail regarding the accompaniments was not mentioned anywhere on the menu so we ended up ordering extra bread, onions and pickles. What we ordered was plenty of food for two people. The ribs were really good, large and tender. The combination of the rub they use along with the tangy guava glaze worked really well. The brisket was also good (I don't know much about brisket, I prefer pulled pork) but my husband on the other hand absolutely loved it, said it's one of the best he's had. I really enjoyed their tangy BBQ sauce. The pickled onions were bland, missing flavor and vinegar. There was also a very nice, friendly man inside (I forgot his name) handing out samples of dips, roasted corn salad, mascarpone dessert which he makes himself and sells them at this location (you'll find the items in the fridge by the entrance, not on the restaurant's menu). Everything we tasted was so delicious but I especially loved the smoked mullet dip and the roasted corn salad.",qbIWjM24UxYZsQKFK94riA,2022-01-15 19:26:59,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,4,Carla
ZgVZ97nxWj6nxlgZxlKW2g,"Wow what a awesome place! If you like BBQ, grilling out, and enjoying the fresh Tampa air, this is your place! To start off, The Brisket Shoppe is the restaurant but this place is more than that! They are an official dealer of the Big Green Egg grills and many others! The shop is called Grill and Provisions and has a huge selection of grilling accessories along with grills for sale. Now onto the restaurant, they have a cute outdoor patio but also offer drive thru for those of us that are on the go. I decided to try the Brisket Nachos and they were amazing! The queso is to die for! There's so many more menu options I am definitely going to be back to try! Please go try it out!!",D1AtPyXN1xYRHRwm71CV5A,2021-07-08 13:55:22,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Charlsey
Ub9siq_EDbjrSJYIxmAGLQ,"Personally speaking there isn't too much great bbq in Tampa but Brisket Shoppe? This place rivals some of the more prominent bbq spots I've had in La. Let's start with the brisket ,  it's so juicy and flavorful it has just the right amount of seasoning , so it doesn't need sauce. I always opt for moist and this was a hit for sure . You'd be doing yourself a disservice if you didn't get this while visiting. I was also given some sausages so kudos to whoever did that because they were delicious :) The potato wedges come with a mustard that's soo good it's not your average mustard and could go well with anything. I was fortunate enough to sit next to a kind man by the name of Carlos who shared some of pork chicharrones and those are next level!! Best I've had , they taste like bacon . The chef Danny came out to greet the customers and ask them how their experience was which was awesome. You can really tell Danny puts his passion into his food and cares for the customers experience . This is a must try in Tampa , the service and food are top notch . GO NOW!!!!",dZVPpzoWIdt7QuEDAHD9EQ,2021-10-16 15:29:26,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Brian
D-uX78V56GxulA6IFBIl2A,"What an experience! It's a little tricky to find since it's inside a grill shop, but it's delicious. The people inside were super friendly and helpful. Really liked how they offer moist or lean brisket. The Mac and cheese was great and they even shared with us a bowl of their chili. I love places like this!",LCxyAmta5743Ks7r1zjwIg,2021-11-07 01:21:33,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Erica

wfroHlBxg405jt9MQ1-o3Q,"In love with this place and it's people. The chef Danny is so friendly and checks up on everyone eating their food. It's my second time here but I feel like family. Let's start with the brisket because I know everyone is wondering how it is. It's good..... like really good and easily the best I've had in Tampa, scratch that Florida . It's smoky , juicy and oh so flavorful , no sauce needed !! The potato wedges are top notch as well , they come with a mustard sauce that just works , the sauce is not your typical mustard and it was enough for me to enjoy the wedges a lot , I probably should mix the bbq sauce with it though because I can only imagine the flavor explosion I'd get from that. The turkey was so tender/juicy like the brisket with a smokiness and faint sweetness. Best turkey I've had bar none it's bananas . The jalapeño cheddar sausage is just what you'd expect and more , just the right amount of kick and cheddar flavor complementing it makes this some amazing sausage . I think I got a pieces of the hot links with my brisket order the first time but this jalapeño cheddar is where it's at . Lastly we have their coleslaw , it's hearty and so balanced . Danny doesn't miss at all , everything he makes is with love and you can taste it . Shout out to Sonia and Danny for making every experience so pleasant . Amazing food and a must try in Tampa easy 5 stars",dZVPpzoWIdt7QuEDAHD9EQ,2021-11-06 17:43:30,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Brian
eJ3PAKLcAoo7eu4m1qdOaQ,Only FIVE star. This is the best brisket in town!!! Me and my husband had been looking for Texas style bbq for long time until we found them. Their brisket is super moist and flavorful. And the rib is also very tender and juicy. We had the side dish bake potato which is amazing ! We love the owner he is extremely friendly and so welcoming. Our friend from Kansas City even said this place beat all of the bbq they had in KC. Definitely want to go back again and I don't think I can go to any other bbq place except this one from now on.,IsobkeeYo-tPOTbEF6ljMA,2021-11-03 04:47:35,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Sara

Seriously some of the greatest brisket you'll find anywhere in Florida. Made with USDA prime meat too!! Ribs are insane, sausages, thick cut potatoes fries are next level good... pickled onions it's all just how you want it. The owner Danny is a pleasure to talk to and youll know immediately how much he loves creating good food for the people. Also need to mention that they have the best pork rinds I've ever had in my life.

pJhKfhjL69LOR05KVnjhow,"On our way to the Bolts game Saturday afternoon, we decided to try out The Brisket Shoppe. We are so glad we stopped in! We split a No Bull Shit sandwich and it was truly no bullshit! The baguette was the perfect choice to hold in all the goodness of the Texas link and brisket slices. What sets this bbq sandwich apart is that it is not covered in sauce, drowning out the flavors of the meats - sauce is served on the side. The sausage had a nice snappy casing, the brisket was tender with excellent smoke flavour. BTW, this sandwich was only $12. I would have priced it at  around $16.95 or so. I'd happily pay over 30% more for it. We also had a chance to try the Mac and cheese and it's pretty good. Nice crust. A good Mac and cheese, in my opinion, needs a nice crust. Too many other places are no-crust slop. We also ordered the potato wedges. Usually, wedges aren't my thing, but they looked so good in pics online. They were amazing. Served alongside a house made garlic aioli. Side note: if you taste the aioli on it's own, you will notice how good it is and will want to put it on everything.Can't wait to go back and try other items. Super nice owner. I enjoyed my food so much that I didn't care that it was 95degrees out. Yum, yum, yum, yum.......",GtHwWz1U11ws3A23uLbZHg,2021-06-06 21:06:38,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Joanne
lUJPPXLBvUcItVoRW1N8lA,"This is the BEST Brisket in the Land! It's so good that I just order it from them instead of trying to make it as good as they do. We got a box for Father's Day and the Sausage was a big hit with everyone. The Breakfast Burrito on the weekend is amazing. Cool chill laid back vibe. The people that work here are super cool, just excellent people. They also have a good selection of beer- that goes great with the food. I highly recommend checking out the Brisket Shoppe!",2xgccdbFf_Ce5KCCF3r6Tg,2021-06-30 13:15:16,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Michael
7P2qV3i5eAaYxE-re60CXA,"My husband discovered The Brisket Shoppe during his morning walk with our dog. I admit I was initially skeptical when my husband suggested we have breakfast here this morning. Barbecue at 9am?! My husband seemed really excited about his new discovery so I decided to give it a chance. Upon arrival I only saw the ""Grill and Provisions"" sign and the grills for sale on the porch and thought my husband might have been mistaken about breakfast being served. We were quickly greeted by multiple friendly faces and confirmed that breakfast was indeed available. Orders are placed at the cash register and seating is available on the picnic tables outside. After making our selections we were informed that the full menu was not available until 10:30 and that the breakfast sandwich and beverages were are only option. This was fine, but I thought it was a little funny that we were offered a menu if there was only only item available at 9am.Luckily, ""The Southerner"" or brisket on a biscuit is absolutely delicious! The brisket is melt-in-your-mouth tender, the thick cut bacon is perfectly crispy and the biscuits are buttery good. Even the side of breakfast potatoes, onions and peppers were perfectly seasoned and grilled. I really liked that Spanish Cava was used in the mimosa instead of cheap champagne and the fresh squeezed orange juice was an unexpected surprise.Everything was so fresh and delicious and served quickly. The casual outdoor seating was perfect for our energetic toddlers. I was really touched that they noticed our three year old wasn't touching the food and they brought him out a quesadilla to eat instead. It's never easy dining with kids, but everyone really went out of their way to make us feel welcome. We can't wait to return so we can try the lunch menu!",5O3VvfDu_HDvgUviAqmTEA,2021-07-17 18:32:30,yfLlpU8h1plvnMgui6xwRw,5,Michelle
