GFsT26Eed1YGCOuAX1obgw,Excellent poke bowl: fresh fish. Crispy Veggies. And the dumplings are excellent too. I've tried it twice since Sunday and both experiences were A+. It's a welcome addition to the neighborhood.,G9zGDJOBYuxFQAX0Nt3QoA,2021-08-04 01:04:32,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Carole
_ziHC2kppW9n-ZuBJX3HJw,I'm so glad I finally got to try this today!!! The fish was so fresh and full of flavor. I got the Philly bowl  and my friend got the Fiery Dragon bowl. Both were great and we also split the mini vegetable egg rolls which came out hot and crispy. The ingredients are all so tasty and I highly recommend one of their signature bowls if it's your first time! The staff was so nice and helpful in giving recommendations also. Can't wait to come back soon! Welcome to the neighborhood!,fGIap6ckTYui9CZq9RxaCA,2021-10-17 01:22:54,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Amanda

EVERYTHING ELSE! Awesome service, courteous, and an overall nice dining experience. I'll be back!",v0OSiwQR8Yo5VZYPNUb5AA,2021-09-14 18:25:42,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Malika
Gj7zpttOoC6i9Uxh-ozSsw,My new favorite poke spot! Everything was so delicious and fresh. What I like about this particular poké spot is that their menu is not exclusively poke like most places. They have a very good menu and everything we tried was great. The staff was very nice and everything was very clean. AllOf the food came out pretty fast considering they are short staffed,PK2kykgD1yNc1xj9qrelWw,2021-11-29 19:06:42,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Patricia
vTaoLW0eDnDrhwbWgoJt7w,Food is very good but they are very expensive. Its almost 20 for a burrito or a bowl.  Poke falls are good too and are about 5 dollars cheaper.,bM1bNeIDFBvEniHMQ2XEAg,2021-10-02 20:37:55,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,3,Francisca
UA2txXueSjFDvjlcuMcKXQ,Excellent poke bowl!!! Fresh and delicious. I hope they create some sort of loyalty or rewards program as we will be returning many times!,OLXAts-3_KsvGMerxegTcw,2021-09-26 12:50:09,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Alexandro
FQc0e4B7jCFtisVLAYczHg,"Thrilled with their food. I ordered a spicy tuna burrito with avocado, cucumber,sesame seeds, spicy mayo and soy sauce. My partner ordered a spicy tun bowl, I had a taste and it was amazing. So easy to order, the menu is well set up. Sometimes poke bowls can seem complicated to order, but not this time. Reasonably priced, fresh and tasty! Will definitely be back.",Pjca_7hm05TpawOcKQkw5Q,2022-01-09 16:38:27,jrUso5L85sDzeBj7KqLhJg,5,Lee
