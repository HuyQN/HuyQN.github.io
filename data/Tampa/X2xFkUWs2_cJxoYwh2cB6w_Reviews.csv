MRlI0sF9f2P_Wmhb_-7kpg,"Small ""hole in the wall"" sushi joint down the street. Got take out and it was great! Loved how all the sushi roll boxes were labeled to tell us which rolls were which (wish more places did that!). Sushi was fresh and delicious!  Glad to have this place so close! Great addition to the Westshore area! Can't wait to explore their ""off the menu"" items!",tmYkH4-D6ZlqWFLFN4eQWA,2021-09-27 00:51:35,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,Alex
bqUt3xBVuxPGv74UZ0aBvg,SO GOOD!! We found this hidden gem accidentally and I'm so glad we did! The sushi rolls are delicious with the right amount of rice around the sushi. The service was also really great! They were quick and very friendly! We will definitely be back!,72C2tVkvFveoJp-0T_l8_A,2021-11-22 01:48:27,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,Sandra

Every piece of fish was incredibly fresh, and the flavor and texture combinations were unreal!!!",fGMH4IXPmBHEiCwS6XOpGA,2021-10-01 23:13:10,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,L

Made a road trip to Tampa to check out the newly opened BluWave Sushi and it did not disappoint.To the right is the CRYSTAL ADDICTION - Rice paper roll and choice of Tuna, Salmon, Yellowtail.  Avocado, Cucumber, Crunchies, Green-Leaf Lettuce, Cabbage topped with Spicy Mayo and Wasabi Roe.Quite the name! I think I felt a food 'high' after eating.. lol jkTo the left wasn't on the menu, Chef's choice.  What I can say is that it was highly delectable!Also had the Seaweed Salad in the back, can't go wrong with that, yum.The artistry at this establishment is beautiful.   Very cozy place, highly recommended!",ZQ0gvRkBomZ-g6shMFlNBA,2021-09-11 22:29:27,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,Bruce
vE-Y9sBf-NFDkiYx_v7AAg,"This place is AMAZING! I've been wanting to stop in since they opened, and I'm so glad I finally did. The sushi is so fresh and delicious. The decor is modern and clean. It's not over the top like I feel most sushi places are with their fancy decorations that are hoping to distract you from their lackluster sushi. You can tell that the owner, Harry, really cares about the quality of the food and the service to the customers. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu, and will definitely be back soon!",U07iMOCa5-0NwZT7f5xvsw,2021-10-15 20:45:58,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,Ashleigh
tE-DkHekZUXd2WE9vTkd1w,Everything they have is absolutely delicious! WOW! Lucky us we live 5 minutes away from them. The rolls are fresh and delicious. We crave their rolls. I recommend everyone to check it out.,ff6NlmCsQJRCvsarwoMugA,2021-12-29 01:42:24,X2xFkUWs2_cJxoYwh2cB6w,5,Aries
