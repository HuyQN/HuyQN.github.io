NOsdD03MpSmLxsMLhyllJw,"This place is really great! Your typical Texas style BBQ. It's cafeteria style serving. You grab a tray and move down the line to pick your selections. The food was great! I would say, perhaps a little cold, but I was also talking a lot so that could have been on me. There were many TVs and a bar inside to watch the game. It was too cold to sit outside, but there's a large space set up with tables, games and a bar.",h9HVoUvR2Mz13gp_XEbHSg,2022-01-15 23:00:56,22Zhfb78DHpyDlAAnfU1LQ,5,Brianne
nb-9vJzcFZuJ-PYVrOqewg,"10/10! Such a great large outdoor space and a little bit of indoor seating too. It's cafeteria style so you walk through with a tray and grab what you want. Absolutely great selection of meats, sides, bread and even dessert. They have a full bar outside too if you want a beverage. Everything on the menu here is absolutely amazing. I personally always get the pulled pork, Mac and cheese and banana pudding. My husband tried the brisket and it melts in your mouth. Great potato salad, it's not super heavy with the dressing which i like. We also tried the chocolate cream pie which was almost as great as my grandmothers. Good spot for a weekend lunch trip to watch some football.",SwxuPD4AeQ8-VJWk1R8G_g,2021-12-27 05:24:15,22Zhfb78DHpyDlAAnfU1LQ,5,Merricks
CJEVk3K9ubyvvwyR0z537g,"I'll preface this by saying I'm a KC BBQ fan and Memphis style comes second. This met neither standard. My biggest complaint is that by the time you wait in line and get your food it's cold. Who wants to eat eat room temperature mac and cheese and bbq? The greens were bland and super salty. The STL pork ribs lacked any kind of rub and were a little lacking in flavor. The pastrami I wanted to like but it was just too much salt overload and my slice of brisket was 50% fat not to mention meals here are super pricey with the per 1/4 lb prices and $4 sides. For two of us with four sides, five 1/4 lb meats, and one drink it came to $62.",bMY4XnROqrpxLNI7MoSjwQ,2022-01-08 19:24:01,22Zhfb78DHpyDlAAnfU1LQ,3,Jennifer
1Jdy59Vgc_Jtu8TUs_nRRg,"First time here & as you walk in - you get a warm welcome! It's cafeteria style, so grab a tray and saddle up to the bar (I mean the food bar). Started off with Beans and Mac & Cheese, plus some potato salad! The sides are probably the best sides I have had in awhile at a BBQ restaurant.Then you have to go for the ""meats!"" Great choices! We had ribs, jalapeño sausage, brisket (lean and fatty and pastrami (lean). The sausage was awesome - not spicy and delicious! The fatty brisket was amazing and the lean was okay. The ribs were a bit dry for me, so that was a bummer (maybe we got there too early?). The pastrami was good but I really should have gone with a fatty cut for that. The sauces on the side were fantastic!The tea was awesome and they have a full bar outside! The staff there is just fantastic and really customer service focused - staff gets 5 Stars ! Plus outdoor and indoor option is fantastic! Indoor is great but their outdoor space has plenty of TVs and seating, plus some space for kids to run around. Definitely will be back!",Z18Bze20mEVqRXAfe8DjZg,2022-01-02 19:54:14,22Zhfb78DHpyDlAAnfU1LQ,4,Mari
QRkQJdJRHerTnftYDDnZ7Q,"Carey Bringle (of Peg Leg Porker fame) has successfully introduced REAL Texas BBQ into Nashville, Tennessee!!! This place produces a solid offering of quality smoked meats using all of the right techniques to produce incredible flavors, and the sides should not be considered ""secondary"" to the BBQ as they are that good. For meats I selected a Beef Rib (HUGE), Brisket, Jalapeño Cheddar Sausage, and Smoked Pastrami. Opted for some cole slaw and the Texas Beans with Chorizo as my sides. I've dined at some incredible Texas BBQ joints in my time and Carey has brought to Nashville a true Texas BBQ experience. The Beef Rib was so tender (the cutter slid the bone out for me) and great flavors...so very different from standard pork ribs. The Brisket was spot-on tender, moist, and a great smoke flavor. Never had Smoked Pastrami before...this was INCREDIBLE and now I wonder how a shaved version on rye bread might be??? The Jalapeño Cheddar Sausage was good but mild. Nice pork flavor but no real Jalapeño heat or cheddar flavors to get it noticed. As for the sides, the cole slaw was good but the Texas Beans were the BEST I have ever had...period!!! If the line had not been so long when I was done, I would have picked up another quart. Service was exceptional with everyone there making sure customers had what they needed and were enjoying their meals. They are in a great location (The Nations), tons of outdoor seating and the area is dog friendly. From the time I arrived till I left there was a line out the door but it moved quickly.",OT_6Xwvtpl_Hw-UR2yR6wA,2021-12-13 01:48:25,22Zhfb78DHpyDlAAnfU1LQ,5,Joe
