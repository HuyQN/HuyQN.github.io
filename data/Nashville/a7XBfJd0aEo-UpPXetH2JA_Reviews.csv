Q2N7OHqACjuitIoVUYulFw,"DC (During COVID) from what I can see the lady working is wearing masks. My only concern is there are no gloves. I saw her took payments and got back to cooking without washing or sanitizing first. I was craving something nice and warm and I discovered this food truck. Man, that birria ramen and taco is so good! Even though its Tapatío instant ramen I wasn't mad. The ramen was full of meat and packed with flavor from the broth. This food truck is now on my go-to places for comfort food. I can't wait to try the tacos next!",YXPmptAF_K9VcsS7ZauZWw,2020-09-26 23:11:46,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,4,April
J5JDjhCJQAb-malCB6xWWQ,"Swing by Tacqueria El Gum for some amazing tacos  with some of the lowest prices in town! I highly reccomend their Birria Tacos - some of the best I've ever had! One of the most slept on food trucks on in Nashville!

76XJJh2X_IzRWkr6FEdYtQ,"This comes as a shock to no one, but I found out about Taqueria El Gym via Yelp Nashville's Instagram account when they posted a mouthwatering photo of their food a few months ago. I bookmarked the business, and was in the area today which was a perfect opportunity to sample this food truck gem. This is a stationary food truck located in the parking lot of a gas station, which in taco truck world means it's legit and will very likely be delicious. My BF and I ordered a pretty large meal... steak and chicken burrito, tacos (chorizo and al pastor) their Mexican ramen dish and a tamarind aqua fresca. For a little over $20 (CASH ONLY) we had a feast of authentic Mexican food heaven. The ramen was rich and flavorful with a lot of shredded meat in it; I think shredded beef. The burrito was huge and everything was freshly made and delicious. Plus I ended up with some kind of fried taco/quesadilla combo that was out of this world and a bonus that I didn't even order! The employee gave me a nice amount of red and green sauce which is my jam and amazing. I'll be back to try more of their food. It's so good!",2XKlUjHGk9z-2ckFMcBEHw,2020-12-01 04:38:47,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,5,Sheena
vyw5-HWSa2801lOv4T5Dow,"This is by far one of the best pizzas I have had in town. Probably the best. Birria and Pizza, what's there not to like. I need to try the ramen next time. Make sure to bring cash because it is cash only",6XKALu6wtN7FYJDttW3GTQ,2021-10-13 03:17:32,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,5,Ishan
qP8Oht7IRnRW1NkOlcymmA,"Amazing!!!! Best meal I have had in a while. Only issues are it is a little hard to find and CASH ONLY! Food is amazing!!!! It's all the flavors you want served to you in such a creative way. We got the Birria Pizza and it was to die for. It looks beautiful and tastes delicious! It's savory, crunchy, and has a great freshness. Pizza costs $20 and is well worth it. It may not look that big but each slice has so much meat that you are guaranteed to be full. Me and my boyfriend split the pizza and we couldn't even finish it. I think it is a perfect meal for 3 or 2 if you are extremely Hungry.They are pretty fast with their service I think we waited around 10 mins for our food. It was located at a gas station when we went so we just parked our car and waited for them to call. It is a food truck so plan to find a place to sit and eat this or eat it in the car. The pizza is no good cold and I don't recommend rehearing it. so when you get it try to eat it before it gets cold.",9RKd-YlzpnHQ-WvwEbmcSw,2021-09-30 17:23:50,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,5,Natalie
6z054-WUyeQ_SZSgHAcHKw,"Had to show some love to this food truck parked in a gas station lot on Thompson Lane. The employees were friendly, the food was ready in less than 10 minutes and all reasonably priced. They serve up authentic Mexican street food and I hadn't heard of a lot of it but what I had was fantastic. I got the birria ramen ($10) and the queso tacos with birria ($4). What is birria you ask? Their version is a stewed beef with spices. The birria ramen was flavorful and slightly spicy. The queso tacos were two fried tortillas with cheese in the middle then birria served on top with onions and cilantro. Although this is a small and unassuming food truck it's totally worth a visit if you're in South Nashville. The stand is cash only and most likely you'll want to take the food to go since there's only one picnic table and the lot is not much to look at. You can also find their Instagram for more menu items @taqueriaelgym_nashville",Kho08pWNfeGnRbZTnMKy3w,2020-09-26 12:55:17,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,4,Maddie
PZ3Plm05hUe9X5Ba0Zi-Wg,"Just stopped by for a quick Monday lunch.  The taco trailer itself is parked in the lot of a largely defunct gas station. Then again, sometimes the best food is found in the shadiest of locations. I ordered the birria ramen and quesabirria tacos. The woman in the trailer asked me to wait 10 mins, which I took as a good sign.10 mins later, my order was done. I got back to the office and, frankly, was too taken by the heady scent of the food to snap any pics! The ramen was served in a 32 oz foam soft drink cup; a tremendous portion filled with noodles, toothsome birria, and phenomenally flavorful consommé. Total winner. The quesabirria tacos were the larger size, with two corn tortillas sandwiching a layer of melted cheese and a hefty portion of birria, with chopped cilantro and onion. The red and green sauces were both excellent, and not crazy spicy. The picked carrot slices were an excellent foil for the richness of the tacos.$18 for the ramen and 3 tacos; $20 with tip. It was an absolute bargain.Highly recommended for taco truck birria specialties in South Nashville!",DbngXN9CynCCwoQshU5h7w,2021-02-22 19:28:38,a7XBfJd0aEo-UpPXetH2JA,5,Marc
