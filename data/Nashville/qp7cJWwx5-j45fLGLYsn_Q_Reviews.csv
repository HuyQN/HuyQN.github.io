taPB4dsKjHW8V1sQfcfEYA,I really enjoyed my meal at Pokeworks. I was visiting a friend that lives around the corner and we popped in to a very warm welcome and fresh food.  I'm used to poke places in California and this setup had far more choices for toppings and sauces than I've ever seen.  It's nice that they hand mix your protein choice with the sauces before you get your toppings  so it's easier to eat.  When I'm near this location I'll definitely be back.,wp76UdB8tlt9QE4utSBjvg,2021-09-27 01:37:12,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,5,Ryan

I got just a little scoop of the hot peppers in my bowl and it was very hot, so skip those if you're weak when it comes to spice. They have containers of sesame oil, sriracha, and soy sauce to add if you want. I came hungry and the bowl filled me up. The employees were friendly, too! I really enjoyed my meal and will be back!",6nOUE_0SJ1Rj61FUEMex0w,2021-10-04 01:51:44,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,5,Kayla
exG_BfdX1T-wxoTcbHiUkA,"First time in tonight and really enjoyed the whole experience! The place is bright, well-decorated and they have friendly and attentive staff. They have a great variety of bowls on the menu and they even offered to add additional toppings as they filled your bowl right in front of you. The spicy tuna and yuzu ponzu salmon bowls were delicious--made with super fresh ingredients and very filling! It was awesome to have so many different choices and we especially enjoyed the unique spam/rice snack wrapped in seaweed (wish I could remember the name) and the tasty pineapple ice cream (seriously, it rivals Disney's dole whip!) for dessert! I can't wait to go back and try more!",ajzKfSd6cY0L3k-TD3wTeA,2021-10-06 03:53:20,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,5,Kiley
Y_mcz-MbgaBbIpOksHtfKw,"Thoroughly enjoyed my experience at Pokeworks. Was overwhelmed with the idea of creating my own bowl, so I opted for one of their custom bowls: Spicy Tuna. I can't wait to go back to try it in burrito form!",JFFasALH2nycD-sPSLt4Mg,2021-09-22 17:37:25,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,4,Jenna

It is a make your own with competitive pricing and the staff was very helpful and friendly. It's definitely a chain, but off the path of tourist. We'll be back as locals!",JqZrXDKZen9AlxtIhkboqQ,2022-01-11 18:44:27,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,4,Lauren

I noticed Pokeworks was open and it looked nice from the outside, so I wanted to try it out. The interior is very clean and inviting. The staff are very helpful and friendly in explaining the process. You choose either two or three proteins (two is enough) and you choose a base, and then choose your toppings. You tell them what sauce you want and what heaviness (light or heavy) you prefer. I opted for the rice base, and salmon and tuna with cilantro, hijiki seaweed, edamame, kimchi, pokeworks classic ginger sesame vinaigrette, masago, seaweed salad, garlic flakes and roasted sesame seeds. I cleaned my bowl. I loved it so much I have been there twice now lol. The first time I tried a garlic spam musubi. It was definitely more food than I needed but I at least wanted to try it. Loved the flavor. I would love to get the opinion from an actual Hawaiian - maybe you are next to review this place. I love it, two thumbs up.",-SigNCNItQDtSq27j0t_tw,2021-10-16 20:11:16,qp7cJWwx5-j45fLGLYsn_Q,5,Chris
