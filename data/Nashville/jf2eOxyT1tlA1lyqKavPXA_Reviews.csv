rucDDrjA4QLZ5z5RT1Sq8g,"I was visiting Nashville from Tampa, and to be honest, only stopped in because it was close to my hotel. I am so glad I did!!!  Delicious and fresh food. Was relatively healthy by Mexican restaurant standards. Honestly, the best Mexican food I have had in a long term. Apparently, the place is relatively new and I would highly recommend a visit. Service was outstanding and Lisa, our server was great and clearly proud of the restaurant. I wish there were Mexican establishments like this in Tampa tbh",FWbYvfNoaWsW7MULKx5kkw,2021-11-07 00:01:55,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Neil
aGZbRDyBPqzyTMN25aaI0w,"Must say, this is probably the best service I've had in over a year. Eladio was our server, he took time to know our names and was very attentive without being overly intrusive. The chips and guacamole were fantastic and fresh. The carnitas tacos were okay, but I'd probably try something different next time. The margaritas were tasty. I'd recommend the spicy margarita if you don't mind a bit of a kick.",9VCe8tBK6NmLjj8IBi8bLg,2021-11-10 03:33:46,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,4,Michelle
d15jAEccKGJLZZGG3rVlAQ,To start Eladio is fantastic...you couldn't ask for better service anywhere! Came here for brunch....I had the best mother Effin huevos rancheros I've ever had in my life...pretty sure if I'm ever on death row this would be on my last meal request list! The spicy margarita is amazing and a must have! If your in the area and unsure where to eat....stop looking and eat here! You will NOT be disappointed!,LKOz2awAJq8D6lwn8rZxjw,2021-11-13 18:48:52,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Sarah
f4jKIU3DShFVK9EWqhAYng,"Great people, great food and great atmosphere!!!  This place gets hats off to all aspects of a dining experience.  The management and staff are top notch and the food is outstanding.  The chili relleno, enchiladas, salsa and churros were outstanding.  Great flavor, freshly made and not loaded with salt.  Excellent experience.  Would rate this one of the best places to eat in the area.  Will definitely be back next time in the area.  Great job!!!!!",-SrPKmj3LxPS90z1lFAu7A,2021-07-16 23:15:15,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Allison

6ShFreWeo74lWbq62E5XzQ,"My last night in Nashville and I walked in without anything but curiosity and an appetite. I had eaten bbq three days in a row, and I ordered the vegetable enchiladas with salsa verde: it was the most delicious meal I've had in some time!!! I also had a perfectly made original margarita. Attentive and friendly staff, awesome vibe and design. Thank you for a memorable experience. I can't wait to come back.",t7z_KiUK4FEIiareHTrkVA,2021-10-06 03:39:57,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Joe
EWRjF4Fxvifge_v2129esg,"Delicious margaritas, smoky salsa and perfectly cooked chips to start the evening. The ambience is cool with modern decor, dimmed lights and music humming low in the air. The Dia de los Meurtos theme is carried throughout the restaurant with features like a skull wall and figures adorning the entryway. It really is beautiful inside. After starters and margaritas, are dinner arrived hot and fresh from the kitchen. The veggie enchiladas were fantastic with fresh veggies cooked to a perfect temperature. They were perfectly stuffed and flavored without excessive oil. Wish my pics were better, but you can see the generous mix of various veggies that make the dish interesting and satisfying. My friend enjoyed the quesadilla and would recommend it. We didn't have time for dessert but would love to try the churros next time.",cECBYLfkgw9Qby0K4Smy0g,2021-11-26 23:50:07,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Leslie
IOh7xAhqzEyTlJUX2sqwVQ,We came down visit Nashville and ran into Calacas and boy it did not disappoint. If you're looking for Mexican infused cuisine this is your place. Everything we tried was amazing with great flavor and presentation. Staff was amazing and attentive. If your in Nashville please do come visit I'm so surprised this place is not busier what a shame! It is a cool couple blocks from Broadway and totally walkable from there. Please come visit them!,VLM7YvO725bcI7W7w30jGQ,2021-11-21 22:51:04,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Diana

oujgUjprvo3e-3ehIbixWg,"The atmosphere was really nice overall the food was pretty good, the only reason I am giving 4 stars instead of 5 is because I felt like the entrees weren't as good as the apps and dessert",6AFEblCOaK6VwpHb-d9RGw,2021-10-22 03:53:31,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,4,Xian
gl5FuBHAgHtg5Yw7e9lpzg,"Calacas was an amazing a New Mexican food experience. Not only was the food amazing, but the service as well! For our food my party had a quesadilla, enchiladas, and tacos, salsa, and guacamole. All of the food was super fresh and delicious! A wide variety of choices to choose from on the menu. The restaurant provided a comfortable atmosphere and ambient lighting to make for a fine dining experience. Also, our server was absolutely wonderful. My party was here in a trip and she was so lovely and excited to welcome us to Nashville and talk about the area. She made sure each of our orders was correct and made recommendations and suggestions of the menu's options. Amazing service! Probably the best Mexican food I've ever had and would definitely go again!",xxrO0QPSFHre1CDhU8joKw,2021-09-03 01:12:55,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,4,Marc
w_Bah6AiOJdNjZMoxXT86w,"I am so grateful we stumbled upon this little Mexican gem! Great upscale vibe and atmosphere. I wasn't expecting the food to be so good! The drinks (I got a spicy margarita and a regular margarita) were wonderful and fresh. I also ordered the Carne Asada plate and it was fantastically flavored. I would come back for it again. The guacamole and salsa were also great. Hands down, the best most authentic Mexican I've found in Nashville yet!",nt7pfAF198Pl_Y7L5v_jEQ,2021-09-03 00:25:45,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Lisa
KA7hvM2wTZnql3USwHyIlw,"We waited 45 mins for a table when 1/2 the tables were seated.   When I asked the host why we weren't being seated she gave use attitude and said that the it's because the kitchen can't handle anymore tickets. Drinks were excellent, but the service and staff attitude were absolute $h!t.",-jKqtBn08A2pBQqEMqLp6g,2021-12-15 05:09:06,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,3,Biv
1ldzzr2DVI2RzkixNLaGRw,"Had a first dinner at Calacas on a Saturday night, and both the food and service were superb. This is the real deal on authentic Mexican ingredients and flavors in dishes that may sound familiar, but are actually on another level from a quality and taste perspective than the usual. The food overall actually reminded me of some great meals I have had at high-end restaurants in the Riviera Maya and Cabo San Lucas.  Had the Trio of Salsas to nibble on, with surprisingly good Old Fashions made with tequila. Starters were the Calacas Salad and Ceviche; mains of Shrimp and Chicken Tacos and Chingon Carnitas; dessert of Tres Leches; all were excellent, and the Tres Leches (with coconut shavings on top) perhaps the best I have ever had. We will be back soon!",Y-BGED5H76HryuIuvK-OLg,2022-01-09 16:49:16,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Paul
NQ8knir7G3_UGPKTugM4Gw,"Great authentic Mexican food done in an upscale style that elevates the cuisine. Excellent bar with plenty of tequila and mescal to choose from. The owner Paulo was our bartender and was very gracious and helpful. We went on a Saturday night and would gladly have gone back Sunday and Monday nights, but they are closed those days. We left Nashville on Tuesday but will definitely go there again if we get back to Nashville. One of the few Mexican restaurants I have been to that has Mescal de Pachuga and the Gusano to go with it. Excellent!",KDb7KgSSWD1Hh35JurU2Lw,2021-07-21 23:37:58,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Tim
VSfgqbjKSMT_wU108r5IiA,"The drinks were really good. We tried two different margaritas, pineapple and blood orange.  The food was mediocre.  Service was mixed.  Some servers were very engaging, while others had to be engaged.",4ALkVOpBRBEAZu3ncTi4AQ,2021-12-22 19:47:36,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,3,Joshua
wL_qWqUyzSFBZQX9y7YWiQ,Visiting from out of town and we needed to find a place that wasn't packed on the weekend. This was right next-door to our hotel. on a Saturday night the only place we could sit was at the bar unless we wanted to wait an hour and a half. Once seated it took the bartender a while to attend to us because he was slammed busy. But once things got started the flow was excellent. we got our food and drinks and desert in a pretty timely manner. And everything was delicious.,OqdjlzIiRq5cdwg6Wv7k9A,2021-11-20 20:27:27,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,4,Jason

kanmG-uG-1j1b_q_jZ5s0w,"Coming off a great evening on Broadway - we needed a meal to finish our evening. We saw this great new Mexican restaurant on the way home and looked like it could be a great treat. It ended up having great service and even great food. I was reluctant to take the recommendation of the cauliflower taco - so I settled for one Cauliflower and one Pork belly taco. Low and behold, I ordered another Cauliflower because how great it is!! Highly recommend and will definitely come back!!",RHtuNXgGLnhVexzGlS8M7A,2021-11-06 03:59:29,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Jeff

kiArGUfw4lmIA7c8IScWLA,"These folks are trying so hard with staffing shortages in the front of the house. With allowances for that, this place was seriously good. The servers and bartenders are friendly and attentive. Portions are small but the food is not run of the mill chips and salsa. The poblano soup was spectacular and the chile relleno I was easily the best I ever had. And the cocktails were legit. Not 10/10 yet, but only because they're still working the kinks out. Really great experience.",re0POTeMNFdYUF7eTs5-mw,2021-08-01 01:31:48,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Meredith
aZd8Z71YlVNbvPVE-Pr-oA,"On vacation in Nashville, during a freak snow storm and some icy cold weather!! Kinda put a damper on our plans, as we weren't fully prepared for the cold- the forecast was slightly misleading... which leads us to our experience at this restaurant because it was only a 4 minute walk from our hotel- from the moment we called ahead to see if there was a wait- the service we received was phenomenal. All of the people that we had the pleasure of speaking with were incredible!!! The attitude of the staff was upbeat and they were making jokes and bouncing around! The spicy margarita was delicious, the food was perfect. It was a perfect experience for us as our trip started off a bit disappointing, but this restaurant turned our whole trip around!!",BT5KHILRJQeHA6GPy8Xstw,2022-01-08 03:16:01,jf2eOxyT1tlA1lyqKavPXA,5,Ariel

For dinner I had the chili relleno and my husband had the flounder, also both delicious!
