h95L-NYD4pHKEnPbc6FETg,"Let me start by saying how much I love the parent location ""Once upon a time in France.""This was a bit of a let down.The meat and cheese board looked and tasted like something you would serve at a bbq. Pre sliced meat and grocery store common cheese at restaurant prices?The $4 bread and butter was also underwhelming , butter packets!? Our server was fantastic and the only reason for the extra star or two. I hope they improve because as of now they don't really have much to entice a return visit.",VazAKW3mnDHhGsMTPIMy4g,2021-10-25 04:41:02,00FlwcHcngPcmMHzUnXetA,2,Walter
s6yvK8aQcN227_KDYIdVAA,LOVED coming across this wine bar. Such a fun lounge/speakeasy/artistic vibe and solid wine selection. I will definitely be visiting this neighborhood spot many more times!,WukY3xE8KyUa8AwQn6bEXw,2021-10-26 17:34:54,00FlwcHcngPcmMHzUnXetA,5,Lindsey
lAkVpt4CqrT1wG2i1PrpcQ,Great wine bar with a wide selection. If you're looking for a speakeasy this place is great if you're trying to avoid all the tourists and bachelorettes.,KqzNCRAo1XbOE9Gf-B7aSw,2021-10-30 04:13:19,00FlwcHcngPcmMHzUnXetA,5,Christiann
MSVZoYQFZvRLhpoZkQ0XHA,"I'm so glad I was finally able to visit The Authentique! It's tucked away in a nondescript strip mall on Gallatin Road. Once inside you are transported to France. I've never been to France, but it certainly gives off that vibe. They really paid attention to all of the details. The walls, ceiling, tables, lights, bar, etc. were carefully designed. They were playing a mix of music but I do remember Manu Chao was in the rotation. There were plenty of wine options and snacks. We tried a brut rose, two different reds, and a white. All were smooth and had great tasting notes. Price wise too, it was exactly where I wanted it to be. They also carried a bunch of bottles at different price pints. The snacks offered were charcuterie, fois gras, sturgeon caviar, a few desserts, and more. I can't comment on the food, we stopped in for drinks only. This place is perfect for a date night or to catch up with friends. I highly recommend!",JITevzyEgskIJc6sgOyEgw,2021-12-05 17:03:09,00FlwcHcngPcmMHzUnXetA,5,Kristin Marie
