It is not in anyway related to the other place by the same name on the other side of town. Had the Chengdu Spicy Beef (right? Who even has that on a menu?) and Chicken Satay. Satay was delicious but the Chengdu beef was amazing! Perfect portion size for a lunch as well, and no skimping on the protein. Also the spring roll was great, and no little packet of manufactured sauce, it appears to be made in house and is delicious. I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed yet, but I'll continue to add pics as I eat my way through the menu!",VvyxJ_VyTwWGDIzN3_NzPg,2021-08-18 18:07:39,PRK5CTAOyidhiICu5fZwdg,5,Byron
lIwKttoZMxH9beEqsp_low,"I forgot my wallet and they threatened to call the police if I didn't pay before I left, despite assurances I would go and get it and be back within 30 mins to pay. I live nearby and have been there a few times over several months. So, big drama. Paid, won't go back.  With that said, the food is good, the place is comfortable and nice; just don't ask for 30 minutes to get your wallet to pay. Sushi chefs are nice. Waitress not so much.",FVVO1_3Two_X3vjyqaWY5g,2021-10-21 00:40:25,PRK5CTAOyidhiICu5fZwdg,1,Eric

MAzWvzMTzfgswxQIpqX2Dw,"the service and people were really great! They have an extensive menu and hand you an iPad with pictures and descriptions of the sushi which is nice. I only had the dragon roll and shrimp tempura and it was just okay. Not necessarily something I would go back to, but would maybe try their Thai",XRozuuiazpnGW_PJ26gMag,2021-09-22 15:57:38,PRK5CTAOyidhiICu5fZwdg,3,Christina
pRXgZndBfcfxlFskmTCVKA,"I had a great dining experience at Koi midtown!  Ordered Hot and Sour soup-- serving size was impressive and great quality!  Very delicious!  I also ordered 3 sushi rolls- which were just what I wanted!  Very nice atmosphere and service all around!  Much better than the East Nashville location-- which I haven't been back to in a few years due to bad food quality and service..   However, Koi midtown has stepped up the game and I will definitely be back!  Such a nice experience!",-axTjfztnPFVcH7GFuo7IQ,2021-11-17 06:38:49,PRK5CTAOyidhiICu5fZwdg,5,Toby
