KJRN6mMvngcgOhOurNx1Sg,"We finally came here and were not disappointed. Friendly staff, good selection of bottled Mexican drinks, great menu! I can't wait to come back and try more food. Cash only & they are inside the ice cream shop.",p9EVn2HV6nF8BMDphSu91g,2021-08-04 14:55:04,KPofPh5SmzKumg-PpbAEYw,5,Karri

NWJU9KEdv_aBQsy4b-UBWQ,Wow!! So fresh and delicious. Literally the best mole I've ever had  I ended up dipping my son's fries in it just to get last drop. I was unfamiliar with Oaxacan cuisine and looked it up on Wikipedia. Apparently the area is known for its cuisine and Frida does not disappoint. After leaving my wife and I were looking at the menu for what to try next time. I had a tluyada and it was so different from standard Mexican fare. Still very latinamerican tasting but unique. Spice level on the dishes we had we're pretty mild which was great because it allowed the lighter flavors to shine! Can't wait to go back! Also as other reviews have said it's in the back of an ice cream shop and you have to try the ice cream too. Delicioso!!,2p82TuXY2tLVmeuBBtg2tg,2021-12-09 16:19:01,KPofPh5SmzKumg-PpbAEYw,5,Eric
KZYPbEDKnnZzZaMPiC1e3g,"My wife and I have been watching food shows that feature food from around the world.  One of these featured authentic food from Oaxaca Mexico a place we've never been to.  They featured an authentic dish called a Tlayuda. A home made 12 inch huge corn tortilla filled with blended black beans, queso fresco and a ""curtido"" type of salad with cabbage and jalapeño and crema either filled with your choice of meat  of simply put on top. We searched Yelp and this hidden away gem popped up. Frida is an authentic Oaxacan hole in the wall inside but way in the back of an ice cream shop. We ordered to go. ""Cash Only"" by the way and the service was spot on. The food was fresh and very home made. Obviously we had to go for the Tlayuda con carne which comes in a pizza box, that how huge it is and did not disappoint with it delicious flavorful fillings and awesome very well seasoned thin carne asada very soft and easy to chew. Tasted like Mexican home made carne asada the kind I grew up eating back in California. And of course seeing the Mole chicken plate we had to go for that and oh man, it was very creamy and not too sweet with the spices and chocolate flavor lingering in the back of your mouth authentic to Oaxaca cuisine, with a side of rice and fresh made to order corn tortillas. Mmmmm! My wife also decided to get an order of the Fritangas and she chose the tacos dorados de Tinga which is chicken sautéed in a spicy red tomato sauce rolled in a corn tortilla and lightly fried to perfection. Delicioso! Don't forget to ask for extra salsas to drizzle over your food and give it the extra special seasoning spice.  There are way too many ""antojito""  items to choose from for one sitting and the food was plentiful. We will definitely be going back for breakfast items. That said don't expect to arrive at a very fancy upscale place. It is a hole in the wall with plenty of seating but not much ambience, ordering take out is the way to go. Make sure you don't tip your boxes in the car on the way home so as to not spill the delicious sauces that come with your food.",IXKJAH8llKM55qnqSyTUxA,2021-08-23 16:37:06,KPofPh5SmzKumg-PpbAEYw,5,Josh
F5aOMiMuql9cGLyopiOFOw,"The decor and street won't get you to come in, but often times the unassuming locations or dining room has some of best dining experiences. We took our kids here for a dinner, and we had a great evening. Some of the best and most memorable meals I have ever had are when you might not share the same first language as your server, and these are the type of places we need to support. Great and friendly service. The empanadas were on point. Your standard cheap Mexican food this is not. Far more complex and well worth your while. Check your pretense at the door, just come to enjoy home made food and Jalisco and coke with real sugar.",WNa82TF2YdiAhNGIUf9W0A,2021-12-31 04:16:34,KPofPh5SmzKumg-PpbAEYw,5,Greg
