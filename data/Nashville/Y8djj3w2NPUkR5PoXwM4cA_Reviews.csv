C2xlJlysptJzE3eH8evaXw,"Wow! This place is exceptional! From the starter salads to the flavorful mussels-- I could hardly wait for the main course. :) I enjoyed the blackened salmon, my husband got the signature fish n' chips, and my 2 year old son got the linguini with marinara and meatballs. We were in HEAVEN! Everything came out piping hot and was perfectly cooked. It was a wonderful way to end Mother's Day! Boston Commons, we cannot wait to come back!",4R0VR2obUUbieOf19apCxA,2021-05-11 01:20:49,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Marissa

nmSftuuskmUaWO4--mSE3Q,"Lucky to find this spot, was intending to goto the Treehouse but it was too busy. Thank god. I had the best lobster roll and the Guinness was amazing too! Fries which I shouldn't eat were awesome. My wife had the Salmon and she loved it. Must stop. The Bar staff was fantastic! Great atmosphere.One last thought get the Boston Cream Pie!! Holy cow!",oGAzmfFcCPNwFjRvVZjG2g,2021-05-01 01:15:47,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Tim
kzJH9p7XGTnNo9bwaw_Y4Q,Flawless experience. We came in close to when the kitchen closed and they were so friendly and accommodating to us. Michael was our server and did a fantastic job taking care of us so late. We appreciate Boston Commons for being a reliable local spot with great food and service.,_6sJEArMwrsRwHCeI9UR5Q,2021-06-13 21:50:52,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,MaryKate
s7MwoF0PUwfivrLxDDYPJQ,Boston Commons brings that authentic feel to the heart of east nashville. The seafood filled menu is a nice reprieve from the southern delicacies dishes out across the city. I tried out the New England fish and chips (one of three variations) which came recommended from the staff. The fish came out beautifully golden brown and extremely crunchy. I felt like the breading was a little overpowering but it was a very solid portion of fish. The fries came in a paper bag and were a rather small portion compared to the fish. Everything became a bit hard to eat due to the small plate the meal was served on. Overall though Boston Commons is bringing some diversity to Nashville with a pretty authentic dive in New England fare.,5xWf4juNyKMKpB3PGgmtkw,2021-05-19 15:32:56,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,4,Grant
-VL80FL9aOvPUHtjW_2R2g,"The best fish and chips this side of Boston, although I'm pretty sure these guys could give  those New Englanders a run for their money. I really enjoyed their brand new large outdoor patio, it's the perfect place to grab an afternoon drink and some snacks or sit with a big family and eat dinner. The service was beyond excellent, they were attentive without being annoying, which can sometimes be a difficult balance. Now to get the most important part, the food. The fish and chips sampler (cod, haddock, pollack)  blew my mind. They've always had the best fish and chips but their revamped version where you can try all three at the same time was both a fun and tasty exploration. You could even tell that their tartar sauce was homemade. The only critique that we had was that we probably could use more chipson the platter. I think they're the only place in town with frozen lemonade, which you can get in a grown-up version (aka with booze) or just a yummy summer drink for your kids. In the mood for a delicious rum drink? Try the patriot punch it's refreshing yet Boozy at the same time. Or give the southern Mule a try, A perfect southern cocktail with a peachy twist. There is no way you can go wrong with stopping at this place for dinner, drinks, snacks, or anything in between.",6fXwEH_F3ascljjmS1oCVQ,2021-03-21 23:59:15,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Kelsey
vr0-vy38AVSa2UB7uhOTyw,"I had the BEST experience with Joseph and the rest of the hard working, attentive staff at Boston Commons tonight. I was desperately craving fish and chips but Google Maps incorrectly said they were closed. When I called, Joseph was incredibly kind and let me order online even during the dinner rush. I arrived on the early side of my pick up time and the order wasn't quite ready, but the staff was so sweet, seating me at a table with unsweetened ice tea (and lemon!) while I waited. Once I got my order home, the fries were perfectly salty and a little bit soft (my favorite way for fries to be) and the Signature Fish was perfect!  I will definitely come back whenever my fish and chips craving strikes again.",ngQK_l9ubujkh8_0nfI_4w,2021-05-01 02:14:24,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Meg
MR2YqumbrpUY4AV25t5kxg,"I've been a Red Sox fan for years, and thought it would be fun to meet a friend here to watch the game with other Sox fans. It would've been with a different bartender. We sat down and she began wiping off the bar for us. I pointed out a small puddle behind the beer pours I didn't think she would see. ""Don't do that"" she said fiercely. Embarrassed, I Immediately apologized Explaining that I didn't think she could see it from where she stood. ""I see everything"" she claimed, and I felt scolded. I was scolded again for asking for a menu while she was still wiping up. I was told to be patient. The food was a long time coming. Around the sixth inning I needed water. My friend waved his arm to get her attention. Even more fiercely this time came another scolding and ""don't do that, my name is Crystal"". None of these scoldings was accompanied by a smile. She forgot the water. It was half an inning later, when she had walked passed us 5-6 times that she remembered. By now I just wanted her to evaporate so I kept my eyes on the game and ignored her. She noticed and switched to a suck up. Fawning over me when I no longer wanted to be there. I asked for the check. She didn't charge me for my second glass of wine. I doubt she paid for that out of her tips. I'm writing this because I regret not stiffing her. If you visit this bar call first to make sure it's Crystal's night off.",B-4ZlTr2nb-m9erCa-iX8Q,2021-10-16 13:48:26,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,3,Very
tySzuoVV-8WPyofP1Y1Uag,"Very pleasant service. Welcoming and accommodating staff.They got our order wrong and fell over themselves to fix it.Food was tasty but ... breading is too thick and was too salty today. Fish was good, haddock a little dry. Shrimp , clams, oysters and scallops were all cooked correctly and tasty (breading still too thick).Introduced me to a new wine, Hive & Honey, which I enjoyed.",UY0yFZduykp8t8fnJ8_-hg,2021-05-08 00:46:01,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,4,Patrick
4pVBM-cwnlVvLhtULxQQog,Went to dinner at Boston Commons. We thought we were going to a different restaurant located at that location but it had closed down and a new one had opened. Boston Commons took the place of that restaurant so we stayed. The food was good with the exception of the clam chowder. My cousin had to ask for warm cream to cut down the clam chowder because it was thick like paste. Otherwise everything was really good the atmosphere was kind of bland but nobody was in there in the restaurant side. The bar area was very busy but only a few tables were busy for dinner. I would say that I would go back. I do believe that the waiter made a difference. He did a great job serving his house and also providing all our needs.,JZdv2hMgNXiktNXSyKUSKw,2021-06-26 19:19:41,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,3,Ed

zIZ0kp5SrwgClY_PKmaDag,"Visited the newly renovated Boston Commons (formerly Battered & Fried)...love how the place looks with the large outdoor seating area. Chatted with the greeter (did not get his name) about the changes and he seated me at the bar where Dana greeted me and got me a menu. The new menu is so much better, refined, and matches the theme of the restaurant. Started with a Sam Adams Lager and ordered the Lobster Bites appetizer and went with the Signature Fish & Chips selecting 2x Cod Loins. Now deep frying lobster can be a challenge and turn the meat rubbery...not the case here. These were delicious and I loved the breading along with the spicy aioli dipping sauce (although it really isn't spicy). I could have done a single cod loin, these things were huge! The breading along with the panko really compliments the fish but also makes the dish stand out from your standard ""fish & chips"" offerings. The cod was moist and flaky, the fries very good, and the slaw was delicious. I did ""accidently"" dipped a piece of fish in what was left of the aioli, and I asked Dana for another container of the aioli. The combination of the aioli with the battered fish really was a solid flavor mix and although the tarter sauce was good the aioli hands down really went well with the fish.Great food, service, and a new atmosphere with the renovations after the tornado damage. Great to see Boston Commons rise from the damage even better than before!!!",OT_6Xwvtpl_Hw-UR2yR6wA,2021-04-04 02:37:59,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Joe
MXCUOvKXDbrFf4JrHI6bHw,"I'd only been here once before back when it was Batter'd and Fried. The name change and new ambiance definitely gives you more of a feeling of what to expect. I honestly felt like I could have walked outside and been met with Boston Harbor.I'm allergic to seafood, so got the chicken bites - such a huge portion! Ended up taking a good amount home along with half of my cheesecake (also delicious).One friend ordered the fish & chips (can't remember which one) and the other the shrimp. We were all delighted with the food. They also go the Boston Creme Pie to share and loved it, too.We went to watch the Red Sox play and it was SO fun being there with other fans and celebrating the win. I did try to go to another game, and despite seeing an empty chair (I was alone) at the bar, I was turned away. Other than that, all good experiences here.",zcQ2Xlh2wf5gB1WKUegjBw,2021-11-04 16:53:29,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,Heather Rene
SXZc9G1-JLk5ivZ_0-i2LA,"Boston Commons is a staple in our restaurant circuit. We highly recommend this place! Their outdoor seating is exceptional (and dog friendly!) We we're blown away by the service. What seemed like the manager ensured we were taken care of every step of the way. He adjusted our tables umbrella for us, and even provided us with promotional sunglasses as a courtesy on an unusually sunny day! The food was TO DIE FOR! Highly recommend.",62XSokt_lDsEKCZVcJ2teg,2022-01-03 19:54:23,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,5,S
b9dpipG0bGP_UFle675p1w,"Cute place. Although the menu reads like a nicer restaurant, it is more like a sports bar with a lot of TVs. Service was great- very friendly. Food was just okay. Chowder was so thick. It was more like gravy. Naked lobster roll was not that hot and felt like it was microwaved instead of cooked. Fries and mozzarella sticks were good though. Great outdoor patio. Maybe check it out and order something besides the chowder and naked lobster roll.",uLh40ai6t7P4d_SVMet6yA,2021-11-07 12:45:10,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,3,Adrianna

k1cm8hN_H4ZKebkP3eDgaA,"We made a reservation ahead of time and was seated immediately upon our arrival. Our waitress greeted us and took our order right away. She was very cordial. About 5 minutes later we received our drinks.45 minutes later, no food, no refills and not a single visit from our waitress. We let her know it's been 45 minutes and she says they had a lot of to-go orders which apparently took precedence over walk-in patrons. We request water while we continued to wait for our food.A gentleman brought us our waters. I tried to ask him an ETA on our food and he literally walked away as I was speaking. It wasn't wasn't very busy or loud inside so it's hard to imagine he didn't hear me talking.A gentleman came out of the back and gave an in-depth description about his baked goods. He was polite and seemed very passionate about his desserts.At the 50 minute mark we finally had our food delivered. The food was great. Our waitress closes out two tables near us but still not a single follow-up.We noticed people at the bar getting their food within 20 minutes of sitting.Food = 5 starsService = 1 star***UPDATE 11/28/21***The owner, Matt, reached out to me. We exchanged a couple emails then he called me. We had a lengthy conversation. He is truly passionate about his restaurant and culture that he's been building.Dining out is an experience. It's not just about the food and it's not just about the service. Our experience prior to speaking with Matt was 2 stars mainly because of the lack of service we received. After speaking with Matt I've decided to update my review to 3 stars. Good, decor, ambiance and management all get 5 stars. I'm hoping this was an isolated experience. We plan to patron this establishment again and will post an updated review should anything change.",tswlTKhl5zrtUWJwZNYsDg,2021-11-25 02:09:00,Y8djj3w2NPUkR5PoXwM4cA,3,Jon
