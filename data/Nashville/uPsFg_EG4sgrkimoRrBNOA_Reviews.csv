qxY9-NSIoAh9R_opRZoKrg,"This place made me want to hip-hop dance, and I half-turned into a werewolf. It was that good. Really loved the carnitas and barbacoa. The quesadillas are unlike any I've ever tried. The horchata was wonderfully refreshing. And the staff couldn't have been more friendly and welcoming. Highly recommend!",muDeNEtm5L9BNyqxCl-rpw,2021-05-05 18:38:54,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Dave

5gASgzV6CERlkJnMwLyEsA,"Fast and friendly service in a spot that feels like a food truck anchored to an outdoor patio on a very busy street. We tried four different kinds of meat in our tacos and weren't disappointed in any of them. Good green and arbol sauces in squeeze bottles. Even better, free parking adjacent to venue, which is hard to find In This part of town. That said, despite Nolensville-looking digs, the prices were kinda steep....considering the venue.",K_88Xi5HEkIjikPm1ojLtg,2021-11-22 01:49:46,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,4,Adrian

G3qsiwaVVUqJTYyk2EKAAw,"This is an honest-to-goodness, family-owned taco joint with both porch and indoor seating. We visited Family Tacos for their taco Tuesday discount special. There's additional parking in their private lot, so don't feel intimidated by how busy Charlotte Avenue gets around rush hour. Trust me, the tacos are worth the dinner rush home.At the counter, they will ask you if you want the taco Tuesday special or their regular tacos. This makes me think that, possibly, the amount of meat and filling might differ? Regardless, we got about 3-4 tacos a piece, and that was enough to satisfy two grown adults. I believe I had the carnitas and al pastor. We ate them extremely quickly, especially with their generous helping of lime wedges and house salsas. Given the awesome deal, I was surprised to see plenty of seats (and parking) available. You should definitely check out this tacqueria gem in West Nash.",k2RPYM69kQRKuVlK97H6JA,2021-11-02 19:43:35,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Sherry

mR7PT6ETlKsdz4OrhIVAZA,"So excited to be the first to review and welcome this neighborhood gem!!! The food is phenomenal and Susy and her family were so nice and friendly. Affordable prices, indoor and outdoor dining options, and a lovely, family atmosphere. We had two orders of tacos (carnitas, al pastor, carne asada, and shrimp) and all were phenomenal. Susy even brought us a sample of their beef soup which was soo rich and hearty, delicious. We will definitely be returning ASAP and so happy to have this cute family business in our 'hood!",XyBkEKQinxp-8DqgeXMvRw,2021-03-04 03:16:52,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,J

b_PjMefMl-DEQ3Iq-UIIvw,"Best Tacos in Nashville, hands down!  If you want a one way ticket to flavor-town, this is your place. I got the pastor and it blew the doors off any pastor I had prior. The fish taco slaps so hard you need to sign a waiver before eating it, that's how good it is. Tacos: 16/15. The charros were one of the best tasting desserts I've ever had. 100/10.",1Y_lXlWre1FDR-fATGgo7g,2021-09-25 18:40:40,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Greg
02FywLZKHOia8nlCE-ZXvg,"Congratulations you found great foods. I'll say the torta bread is perfectly crispy and soft. Carne asada is marinated and spiced nicely, making for a great meal along with a crispy quesadilla and some orange soda. The staff is friendly and hospitable, I got a free taste of the horchata which was delicious. Fast, affordable, and they have breakfast burritos. I will return!",2C5M6x1TEbRX_cWp4yTc3A,2021-03-09 00:47:31,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Dan

Ir3j4cxuX4cXcmUgXMP-PA,"I was super impressed. I had one of their unique fried quesadillas. I added carnitas and it was flaky and cheesy and amazing. After I ordered, I found out they offer tamales on the weekends so I got a couple of those for later. One was pork and the other was jalapeño and cheese. I was shocked when I opened the box and they were wrapped in banana leaves. They were so delicious and totally legit. I'd highly recommend Family Taco.",YsHeiXC9IYy0ZVL7MS6_Pg,2021-05-01 05:26:26,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Brad
Jg3zIFNI47bGr1HXbTt4Hw,"I'm sure glad my cousin wanted tacos. I came to Yelp to find a great place to get tacos. We were close to centennial park. And I just look up restaurants that were near me. I found family tacos, which had excellent Yelp and google reviews. I arrived at the restaurant and parked right in front of the restaurant. I should mention that it's on a busy street and when you leave you may have trouble backing out if it's in rush hour. The also have an out door eating area.The customer service is great and the food is amazing. I had the carnitas and steak tacos. Wow! They were so good. The dining area was nice and clean. I would definitely recommend this spot, excellent customer service and excellent food.",CbK0833J0_5DWinDa0zHlg,2021-11-05 00:00:15,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Candace
l9dZf_Dlogat2svgYoleCw,"If I'm eating food I look for a couple of things. Is it cheap? Does it taste good? Does it have chorizo in it? Is it a burrito? Good thing family tacos showed up to satisfy every single one of those points. I live dangerously close to here and since it's opened I've been here 5 times. Every time it's been AMAZING. Plus the serving staff are so nice as well. I debated writing this because I really dont want the secret of this place getting out but I just had to recognize them for being so damn delicious! Oh, and get yourself some homemade agua fresca with the order, your tastebuds will thank you later.",kIRLIsA5OHJAdwoMKLUNOg,2021-08-23 20:39:17,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Sam

5Q-dm49SMjuqs4V6HagvFw,"Absolutely fantastic! I moved from Los Angeles to Nashville and I know my Mexican food. This place is authentic, but unlike many places in town, it actually has really good food. The fried quesadilla is a must have, super crispy and flavorful. The tacos are also excellent. It truly lives up to its name, the owner had his daughter taking a nap on his shoulder while we were ordering.

wMYZb6RoQkZvCPvjYhMjcQ,"I ate the tacos too fast to get a photo. I have been wanting tacos, like the kind I can get on the west coast, because of this stupid pandemic keeping me from my family and the best taco trucks. Well, this place will tide me over just fine. I had a shrimp taco and two fish tacos. That Susy's sauce is spicy and good! The folks there are super nice, and there is a lovely outdoor patio I plan to frequent when this stupid pandemic ends (some folks will probably feel very comfortable there now since it it outdoors and very sweet). Spouse got carnitas, el pastor, and some other kind of meat (sorry, I'm pescatarian). She loved them. Topped with fresh onion and cilantro like the good Lord intended.We will be back!",RmEJbVQqaMRCDxK6ShPdbw,2021-03-15 00:05:23,uPsFg_EG4sgrkimoRrBNOA,5,Laura
