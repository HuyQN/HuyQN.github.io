JkNDaFJfZ5P7QEikTsongw,Great new addition to the Nashville farmers market pavilion. Everything they serve is vegan and packed with flavor. We tried a variety of their tacos along with the corn side and enjoyed each bite. Creative preparations and the tacos are street taco size so you can easily try several. You order at the window and then pickup in a few minutes while they prepare everything fresh right in front of your eyes. There's dining tables in the pavilion or you can take them outside and find a picnic table nearby. Really happy they've got a permanent spot now so we can enjoy their tacos anytime!,G4WtH5P5FUsQfvPJwDU7fg,2020-11-24 20:31:37,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Robin
vF5lXdGLMD2udmFexkNtBQ,"I will never understand how vegan businesses are able to make soy-based food taste like real meat. SVT has outdone themselves today. You could tell me these tacos were normal al pastor and asada tacos and i would believe you. Soy and seitan have never tasted so good. Easily some of the best tacos I've had. My mom and I shared 4 tacos, an horchata, a side of corn in a cup, and a concha/pan dulce for only $24!! Fantastic deal for fantastic food that will fill you up",IcRIc6r4BA9dj_xUeNqLDA,2020-11-28 17:43:20,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Jeremy
9aWTEx1OXjbPWsP8bbU0qg,"Very tasty! I'm not vegan but appreciated all the dairy-free options, so enjoyed the horchata and a pastry and a few tacos. I would've loved there to be more toppings on the taco, like sauces or vegetables or just more to give different textures and more complex flavors. But it was an enjoyable experience.",OMxEyEaXVACiCixqndcOuQ,2021-05-11 18:17:17,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,4,Rachel
6oQasGuqipAZpWy0epGc5w,"Had the pleasure of trying succulent vegan tacos at a recent yelp elite event and I was so impressed by how delicious the tacos were! I tried the el pastor taco and the soy asada, both of which were super tasty, hearty, and surprisingly filling. So flavorful and the texture was amazing. I'm not even vegan and I would go back for more. Highly recommend checking them out the next time you're in the Nashville farmer's market!",kyeyFEYFkDdUK7EJKIx1-Q,2021-09-21 20:54:01,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Allegra
fE3qqbZWvKxA8ZJh6Loeyw,"I am a huge huge fan of succulent vegan tacos. I regularly attended their monthly popups at the farmers market and could not be more thrilled that they opened a brick and mortar! Everything they make is outstandingly delicious and keeps me coming back for more. Their tacos are absolutely a staple and their weekly specials allow them to show off their talents! Everything is homemade (the seitan is a collaboration with the local vegan deli the behive) and so fresh and delicious. The owners are the sweetest people and they truly appreciate your business! If you find yourself at the farmers market, grab a taco or two, you won't regret it!!!!",4tnewyX-g5F5jColXMt3ZA,2020-12-10 04:52:10,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Michelle
hd6U4apbPB94Uyqw3UI75w,"It is rare that I venture to the farmers market, but when I do it's for succulent vegan tacos. I've been to pop ups and tried to support them as much as possible. The food and the company is just so good. I long for the day that I can bust through the doors of their brick and mortar rejoicing, ""ILL TAKE ONE OF EVERYTHING!"" For vegans and non vegans alike, succulent vegan tacos offers true tastes of Latin flair, but with affordable prices, and portions thay feel just right. Gracias amigos! Much love!",FdkstmMEc9371Ij-z4OaPA,2022-01-02 03:46:17,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Elizabeth
NQZn7emWkA4iOH9Lvd6VCQ,"This was a must try for me on our visit to Nashville. Let me tell you, I can't stop talking about it! We were so excited to get to go to the Nashville Farmers Market. When we stopped inside we knew we had to try out the vegan taco place. We went on a Sunday afternoon, surprisingly it wasn't too busy. We walked from our hotel, but there was a large parking lot with lots of parking. Once you got inside there was an abundance of stores, but succulent was easy to find with its green neon sign! While my partner waited in line I found a table, that's the only downside, if it's busy it's hard to find one. We got two tinga tacos, one pan dulce, one esquites (which is a take on elote), and a tamale. The pan dulce and tamale are weekend specials. I am so happy that I did because the tamale was so delicious and the tacos too. But the winner of everything was the pan dulce! It was so moist and pillowy soft. I could eat 10 times. All together for everything it was pretty reasonably priced for vegan street food. I can't wait to go back to Nashville to try more things!",lQI6LNrQMWM8or25ODep5Q,2021-10-27 01:37:53,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Alannah

OFI5vgOcucMuF41apGsnKA,"Located inside of Nashville Farmer's Market, this spot boasts being the city's first vegan taqueria. That accolade instantly drew me in. However, the food was seriously lacking in flavor and was generally forgettable..... almost to the extent that perhaps they were just having an ""off"" day? The taco became much more enjoyable when doused in sauce, but I'm not sure how much of a compliment that is.If I was a vegan who struggled to find options around town, then I would definitely be willing to come back and try again.... BUT that isn't the case, so I don't know how hard-pressed I am to return. Which is unfortunate because the STAFF was SO sweet! Seriously, so kind and so friendly and helpful. If you want to support some kind folks and are OK overlooking the food a bit, then I'd tell you to go.",AIYdAajIPezTm1v_smYTlA,2021-10-16 19:27:15,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,3,Lauren
M5ZODVFJPyORW8YDeHQvYg,"I Love supporting a small business filled with owners dreams and goals.I came here on a rainy Saturday and the decor immediately caught my attention- you will not miss it. I met one of the owners- Ronald. He was very friendly and helpful. He said they had been opened for several months. I love everyone works there wear a mask- this shows me this business cares about the health of their customers. It was an extremely clean place. I ordered 2 tacos, they were all so delicious. Even though I am not a vegan but I couldn't tell the difference that much. I would recommend this place to friends and family members!",rhoYpRGBpyVeNngJgIzy3g,2021-09-20 20:46:03,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Horton
RGck_-XVnnXe1TWOumlhsQ,"After going stir crazy at home I decided to venture out to the Farmer's Market to get away for a bit. I'd heard good things about this vegan spot and decided to give them a try. I decided not to go with their traditional tacos and opted for the special food item of the day, the spicy ""chicken"" torta. Since I was taking it to go I didn't get any additional items of salsas like I normally would at a Mexican place. The torta was fresh and delicious. It had the perfect amount of mayo on it; not too much and not too dry either. It also had a nice spice to it and some lettuce or slaw blend. I can't remember which since it's been a bit. Overall, this is a great vegan place that even a carnivore would rave about. I didn't sample enough food to give them a 5 star review, but have a feeling it will be once I am able to return. I'll definitely be back soon to try more items and hopefully give them full marks!",2XKlUjHGk9z-2ckFMcBEHw,2021-02-18 00:36:43,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,4,Sheena
HfnstEJMZlqz2Yr6rv4fUg,"The best vegan spot in Nashville... staff is always super friendly and attentive. The food is FRESH AND HAS FLAVORS THAT I HAD NEVER experienced before. Tastes like authentic Mexican food. I am from Charlotte, NC and we don't even have a spot like this one. Some days I'm tempted to drive the 8 hours to Nashville just to eat at this place.",OV-6q9xvpQU4UdPh_JPxYA,2021-11-25 03:06:15,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Mary
TvXXUkxhtDslU_vNIQAccg,"I was thrilled to find a vegan taco shop at the market. I ended up getting one of each taco so I could try all of them, though probably would have been satisfied with two or three. I did not particularly enjoy the tinga, and the asada was just alright. The papas was pretty good, but the al pastor was the real star. I could have eaten four of just those! Next time.There were some other menu items I was intrigued by, like the esquites and the tamal special, but I didn't end up getting those because I didn't need fod. I did get a concha (pan dulce) and was pretty satisfied with it to finish off my lunch.",xpcb1eyHT44iT2pi_WdeWg,2021-07-01 22:34:57,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Derek
f2llyFmJLIgGlHsiRqKRgw,"Finally! A vegan meal option at the farmers market! Fresh and tasty! Right across the hall from juice bar , so now you can get your fix all in one pop! I ordered the seitan tacos. They were delicious! I could've done with more spice, but it's probably prepared with the average American in mind. So if you like flavor and not a lot of heat, then you will adore these tacos. There might be a more spicy option on the menu as well! The taco shells were soft and double stacked, so it was able to support the taco. It was a very light meal, wasn't greasy, just delicious. I would go there again if I hit up the farmers market this summer. The staff was really friendly! They took the time to chat with everyone as they went through the line. That was an experience as fresh as the food!",y1BysCatWDaasHXXHljwqw,2021-06-08 16:18:27,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Monica

My first job was as a teen in the 90s at the Nashville Farmer's Market selling hot dogs...wow have things changed! These tacos were such a delight, I wish I had a bigger stomach.

UkwzDLYIF0aH_q7kLEehKg,I tried 3 different tacos from here and they were all so good! My favorite one was the potato one. I always appreciate vegan options so I was over the top excited to see they had a fully vegan menu.,BJNM_Tv2ArDFtuwrN6gOHA,2021-08-11 04:47:29,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Heather
JVSbT37BZcsnSn2kZS5EXA,"What a find! Had the papas taco, just perfect (a little more heat perhaps? Fried jalapeño chips would have added that bit of heat and crunch). The esquites was the real star. Topped with crunchy spicy chips and heavy on the lime, this one packs a flavor punch. Perfection",2gaEBscU94LsnkSUpMTfJg,2021-10-28 17:42:18,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Madhu
yvStVNJHXCf6YpsiGZYpcg,"Headed to Succulent Vegan Tacos just before they opened to check out the menu. My initial impression was that the place was super cute. I was quickly greeted by a friendly staff member and ordered one of each taco and the two specials, enfrijoladas and the jackfruit tamale. They quickly packed up my meal to go and I was excited to see the utensils they packed were made of wood. I'm not vegan myself so my standards might be a bit different for tacos but I was still pleasantly surprised how fresh the ingredients were and how they could make the (soy) asada taco taste so much like real meat! The al pastor taco was very good too followed by the less taco-flavored papas and my least favorite, tinga tacos (carrots just seem like a weird choice for tacos). By far my favorite thing was the enfrijoladas--the chorizo flavor, tofu and veggies were the perfect mix! I'll be back to try more, never thought I could enjoy vegan food so much!",ajzKfSd6cY0L3k-TD3wTeA,2021-09-18 17:58:49,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Kiley
bV9KuqQpv6-nMpoIPfzlGg,"Great Vegan place located in the Nashville Farmer's Market! I stopped by as part of a Yelp Elite event and was able to try two of their tacos. Potatoes and the shredded carrots were both delicious, seasoned well and generously portion onto two layers of flour tortillas.I'm not vegan but liked both of them decently! I did miss the meatiness since they were both a bit too mushy for my carnivorous heavy palate.   I would say two are enough for a small but if you're hungry definitely order three or another item.Besides the tacos, there were a couple of other options that looked delicious as well. The staff was also super nice and the place has cute succulent decor!!",GQA0RtfcBDYOpBxAqx_t7A,2021-09-22 04:47:11,qepgYnobwEyWr4oAfDDhyw,5,Stephanie
b9Hcj2GFoidYR6YL5ViG8A,Inside the farmers market succulent vegan tacos has great vegan options! I went 5 mins before they closed on a Saturday and the staff was super friendly and made my meal to order.
