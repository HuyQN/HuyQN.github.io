HNzo2ShytcPEGbjyUzXUuA,"Well this was my first time actually ordering from Finland through DoorDash. I ordered food from them which consisted 2 raspados, Eloteland, the 2 pepi sushi and the torta with fries. Well the Doordasher forgot the torta and I must admit I was upset. She sounded like why you telling me call Funland. I did, I called Funland and I spoke with Vincent which saved the day by sending his brother to deliver the food the Doordasher forgot to bring. He had contacted DoorDash but bcuz the wait time was so long he took matters into his own hands. His brother brought me the torta n fries as well as some chips and soda for inconvenience DoorDash caused. Thank you Vincent and I'm sorry for my attitude. Now I became a fan of Funland The food the everything is amazing here. Obviously satisfaction was guaranteed for me.",kOO6tvtTsrEmInmqCkXgfg,2021-07-27 03:13:05,Q28TlneXws1shf8ymTdxtg,5,Yanet

Kuy5ZPjsaU16Yc2wQxonwg,"Stopped by for a Raspado and it did not disappoint. We had the raspado con nieve with strawberry, mango and pineapple. It was ice, ice cream and fresh fruit. The ice was soft and it had plenty of fruit, there was enough fruit at the bottom of the cup to enjoy at the end. We also had the Nino which was mango raspado with chamoy, tajin, lemon, reilito, serpentine, saladito and tamarind stick, it was sweet, salty and icy. The staff was very nice and our drinks came out quickly. It was bright and clean. They have dine in, take out and delivery. Masks required.",W04RUuzT-dPp7adcLXY--w,2021-06-09 01:19:36,Q28TlneXws1shf8ymTdxtg,5,Nancy
EKrU-dXq_fuBRepgVisL7A,"Ice cold bottle coke on a hot day, yum. The sanoran hot dog was pretty good. The bread had a light toast on the outside but was still fluffy and aerated inside. The bacon warped hot dog had crispy bacon and a lil bit of snap to it still. The toppings, pinto beans, tomato's, and dressings were evenly proportioned nothing over powering. I did like it. The birria tacos, well. Over all it was okay I think this place is well know for it's raspados and more munchie foods. Next time I will have to try some of those.",WQs5JAILHi-pOVP8MsIedg,2021-07-08 01:40:11,Q28TlneXws1shf8ymTdxtg,3,Jimmie
