S9qvz4FiBLsed1cYhxX0NA,"So happy to have this little café in my neighborhood! As soon as I saw the menu, I knew I had to try it. You order at the counter, and they bring your food out to you. There are plenty of nice spots on the patio, but we chose to sit inside an adjacent room with several booths. It has a warm feel with antique touches. I saw that this will also be a spot to hangout when the new Nightjar pub opens in about a week. Our food came out quickly. My boyfriend is a big fan of biscuits and gravy, and he loved the fluffy biscuits and flavorful gravy. He added the poached egg for some extra protein, and it was cooked perfectly. I had asked the cashier what she recommended, and she suggested the Coronet eggs Benedict with the corned brisket. Instead of an English muffin, it was served with a potato base and topped with a poached egg, dill hollandaise, spinach, and fried onions with a side salad. It was incredibly rich and flavorful. I asked for some hot sauce, and the server brought me a house-made fermented green sauce that was the perfect addition to my meal. Next time, I have to try the Lil Dutch Babies served with a citrus cream. Fortunately, I can walk over and enjoy this new spot anytime!",Smp0a9N_J3FS37dRY7RhMw,2021-10-15 16:46:44,BOeBIWjryCt0EyrlAeqTMA,5,Lindsey
OZyzfja0SIKhXZup9aqPaA,"I visited for lunch with some friends on a Sunday. There was plenty of seating available on the patio, but we were told that we should order as soon as possible, because the kitchen was about to get backed up by a large party. Not having been here before or looked over the menu, I felt a little rushed, but I appreciated the heads-up.I ordered the corned brisket tartine and a Bloody Mary. Both were good; the tartine was a perfect light lunch. The Humboldt Fog cheese with the blackberry jam was a nice pairing. I was satiated but not stuffed. I will say this is probably not the spot for you if you're really hungry. Everyone enjoyed their meals for the most part, but one of my friends got the baked eggs and they were a lot runnier than she might have liked.This is a cute spot, and it feels very intimate. Street parking is available. All the staff members we interacted with were very nice, but you don't interact with them much because this is an order-at-the-counter joint where your food is brought out to you.",ZsmLWcqUD5Z8x4CNT9pPTQ,2021-12-05 05:51:11,BOeBIWjryCt0EyrlAeqTMA,4,Ashley
TFiz1PHXwLdAoh-FnQIyNA,"Meyer Avenue Cafe is extra lovely. It has an old European vibe, cozy patio seating and nice food food menu. They also have a small retail area inside the cafe with thoughtfully curated home wares. We were hungry so between my husband and I, we ordered the mezze plate, smoked salmon tartine and the pastrami tartine. The mezze plate was very nice and full of veggies. The toasts on the other hand were lacking toppings. We're not the supersized meal types but I must say that the toppings of pastrami and steelhead gravlax were a little scant. The tartines are $16 of barrio bread with a thin layer of toppings. I 'm 100% happy to pay for quality ingredients, which I know the Coronet/Meyer ave cafe prioritize, but the ratio of toppings to the price point of these seemed a little pricey The tartines were good but under-seasoned as well. We'll return to try other items. The front of house staff was lovely and gracious. Five stars though for good quality ingredients.",6ObFF8-uKnOAlXuSH4TlyQ,2021-11-18 04:54:35,BOeBIWjryCt0EyrlAeqTMA,5,Isabella
jqRQ8t_Jd51mZDvCao74DA,"I haven't been here since before the pandemic when this La Fonda Hermanita, I love Meyer Cafe just as much! There's a cute little store with local items for purchase, great for local gifts! My husband and I ordered coffees, the granola, and the baked eggs - all of it was delicious, I tried all 3 sauces, a habenero, a green and a red jalapeño, my egg was slightly undercooked and runny, but still tasted great and loved the veggies! They don't have a flame to cook on here, so everything is baked.  The booth room was super cute and historic, so cozy as we were the only ones in there! Service was good, they brought us silverware that we forgot, I wish she would told me about the delicious house made sauces for my potatoes, I'm so glad I asked!",EAHCCgMFoJxlOPcCPQ91SQ,2021-12-23 21:20:41,BOeBIWjryCt0EyrlAeqTMA,5,Kim
C2Hmzth0ykBA5FbT0M7zUw,"Passed Meyer Avenue Cafe on a historic Tucson bike tour (recommend this also), and wanted to try it based solely on the peak from my bike into the cafe patio. It was an excellent decision. Coffee was strong, granola tasty; other menu items looked good as did the fresh bakery on display. Only here one more day, but Meyer Avenue Cafe may get another visit tomorrow. Worth a try folks.",8np5yyBLb3cksXlpvh3jrQ,2021-10-29 05:15:28,BOeBIWjryCt0EyrlAeqTMA,5,Jim
