9lXpgTz6JPeu9CWaRvls1Q,Place was ok but would probably not go back. As soon as we walked in it smelled like sewer. The service was slow. Took about 10 mins for someone to come over to the table. The horchata was a bit disappointing. It had no cinnamon flavoring. The food came out really quick! The enchiladas were really good! And the birria tacos were also good. Ok place but not amazing.,tav2vqLQuQr9-MRdHo5d8w,2022-01-08 19:00:48,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,3,Ashlyn
fSjiX4ao7A4KYy4N0NmhOw,"Visited Tucson for the first time and stopped here for lunch. Man, am I coming back! I ordered the enchiladas with rice and beans. Their refried pinto beans are amazing and the pot roast (aka beef) enchiladas with red sauce were heavenly! Normally I like my enchiladas with green sauce but I actually liked the red better here. Order this same dish! You will not be disappointed.",ZoHaUt-DqDD5pMzYi92EDw,2021-12-10 17:18:05,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Ashley
9o5Yjtuvwt8JnVJhL3aBZA,"Who doesn't love delicious Mexican food living out in the southwest there are so many different restaurants to select from I am so happy that we came to see the new location for La Chingada The service was amazing the food superb from the very beginning we will provide it with the wait time of 30 to 40 minutes when all actuality we waited only about 15 minutes very pleased with the quick service we had appetizers as well as drinks guacamole and some of the best guacamole I've had in a long time.I got the birria enchiladas and they were very tasty the meat was nice and moist and seasoned well my friends opted for the birria tacos that's what I'll get next time I come back they look amazing.The drinks were great I got the pineapple margarita, Looking forward to returning I recommend this restaurant to anyone and everyone",JLW2uULP_Q1KXHhToNljcQ,2022-01-01 02:17:44,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,4,Tiffany
w4z7c_398ECiJxDjq7yvQQ,Such a fun place! They moved across the street from  their old location. The new place has more room and feels exciting with the decor and music. The drinks have amazing presentation and taste just as great. We came around Brunch time and the Mole chicki changa was pretty and tasted great! My sister ordered their omelet which she said was super good with the avocado. We also ordered this hot cheese bowl - the queso fundido! Tasty with chorizo but I wish we got more tortillas with it. Overall a very pleasant brunch spot and I'm sure excellent fun over the weekends! We will definitely be back to try out their other options!,D8R8y30SveOawQVP-1lViw,2022-01-18 18:25:34,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,4,Stacy
wyRHsOzBeNpvZ6Seth-S1A,"Took forever to seat us, it was 4 of us. Little too crowded, food was alright, horchata tastes watered down. I had the enchiladas suizas de camaron and the mazapán horchata.",kot2x2XmamwWDFz7HkeQPA,2022-01-09 01:51:01,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,2,Allison
hhabajlWcQ11VJdW_TgRrQ,"Im a Nacho girl... the birria nachos are a must! I dream about them! The atmosphere is cute great place for date night or girls day. The unique, creative drinks they serve and the presentation of the chicken tortilla soup were IMPRESSIVE!Yum, love this place! The fact I didn't stop to take a pic before I inhaled it says a lot!",4Ds2SqZNw7yo_bHnObSlmw,2021-12-06 16:54:17,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Vanessa
ey53f4ICyO5PoBIvILYSUw,"First time at La Chingada, their new location has a great atmosphere it's very lively and it made a perfect date night spot! My husband and I sat at the bar and ordered our dinner and had a few margaritas. I had the trio enchiladas, they were outstanding! The bartender made us a pineapple margarita and a cucumber jalapeño margarita which was also very good! The service was great both of the bartenders were awesome, very friendly, attentive and helped us make our selections. We can't wait to go back!",OIg74ynG-bzKuuLmFlQuOQ,2021-12-24 02:50:26,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Tonisha
xd9LXjYDAbgNRxB6hBB9MQ,"Stop looking & go, you will not be disappointed. If you're looking for fresh, flavorful, not so ordinary Mexican food this is the place to go. We enjoyed everything we ordered, my husband ordered a carne asada burrito which he was pleasantly surprised to see a generous portion of steak chucks. I had the carne asada tostada with I was so surprised not to see it covered with onions & cilantro!!! High five Chef Martin!!! We will be back!",FAFSh-RgctFzL0-rzBcaMg,2022-01-14 03:37:09,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Eileen
ffTh6kU_bWBbnw0E2PUWFA,"We waited at hosts stand for about 5 minds before anyone came to say hello, even though staff asked by on several occasions. We wanted to sit at the bar and was told it was open seating. We asked the few patrons around if the empty seats were taken,  1 was yes 1 was no but wouldn't slide down to accommodate a party of 2. We were offered a table and served by the bar staff. They were quick and polite but the vibe just wasn't what we wanted. It's loud,  and you can't hear your own conversations. The door we were sat next to, though not in service was a comedy show for sure as more than 30 attempts to come in or go out were made. That made the experience even less enjoyable. Please post some sort of noticeable sign there. The drinks were mediocre and we didn't want to try the food. Needless to say,  no, we won't go back. Rude customers and lack of ambiance mean something.",56XphZMZZeOf7IpEbB__mg,2022-01-13 14:10:26,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,2,AJ
K4vB4jP9ILEJqC3fKcCjMg,Really yummy!  Great restaurant for Mexican cuisine.  We had reservations at El Charro but they were in the weeds and only had 5 workers in the entire restaurant so we left and came here never having tried it.  We are so glad we did!  We were impressed with the cleanliness-probably one of the cleanest restaurants I've been to in Tucson.  The owners take pride in the place-you can tell.  We had great service and meal-we will for sure be back!,6eUUBGdN6_y9sHTsmbCN9w,2021-12-29 03:48:21,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Holly
eZTUBOn7LPuAuqmeSRtTIA,"The food was good. The horchata mazapán was light, not sweet at all (I prefer that way). The mini chimis were soft and crunchy and had a lot of meat inside (not greasy). And the quesabirria omelet was good. The omelet was majority egg white and was filled with the birria*Important: It does get busy on the weekends. Even though they said the wait was going to be 20mins we didn't get seated until 45-50 min. So as long as you willing to wait and be patient also with the staff",V9Y_cIjLMDgniOEcsXhlNw,2021-12-05 21:27:46,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Alex
f3zcsKXEI0NBm78Lh4BLOQ,"First time here and food was great, atmosphere was fun but our server, Paola, was not the best. She seemed annoyed by our presence. Maybe cause the 20% tip was automatically included in our bill.",RI-8tpz7DDvRhDI-xdxjtg,2021-12-31 03:14:05,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,3,Veronica
EotCjwzdvtbnexcjETq5ng,"I was hoping for a great experience due to the high ratings, but I was sorely disappointed. The BIRRIA mini chimis were decent. They had no option for a cheese chile relleno on the menu, but our server said it was available. What he didn't say was that he would charge for the most expensive chile relleno dish (shrimp) and substitute cheese instead. What an underhanded thing to do! I would have complained, but my head was pounding from the mariachi band playing 5 feet to my left. I appreciate the music, and am usually a fan, but blaring a trumpet within 5 feet from me is not pleasant. By the way, the cheese chili relleno was NOT Good. I'm giving it 2 stars because the table next to me seemed to be having a great time, so I'm trying to be fair. Maybe what they had was delicious and makes up for my bad experience",NQPQ2Rn-5oU-1bMrb9mfCA,2021-12-20 03:19:47,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,2,E
3FJ1lty4JZ8t1i-b_ABy3g,"Went to the 4th Ave Fair and were hungry.  Nothing in the food truck area looked good so we were just going to go somewhere else. La Chingada was right near our parking garage and we decided to try it.  Small place and loud, but friendly and the food was incredible. We both had the omelets with the shredded meat and cheese, they came with three sauces all good. Plus a nice small fresh salad. We will be back.",9dbDUWtZ0SbuYHuTfCJe1w,2021-12-16 23:51:49,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Pamela

bYPReinlKqMQyBu7_Xz2Gg,"My husband and I did date night here tonight. We made a reservation on Yelp and were seated right away. I loved the atmosphere and design inside. There are a lot more tables compared to where they just moved from. The patio is super cute and had heaters, but we ate inside. The food was delicious! I had the filete de cabrilla. It was so buttery and fresh, I loved every bite. My husband had the queso broso platter. The birria pizza is out of this world. The nachos were nothing special and had no meat, so he said next time he'd get a full pizza. We also got a beef tamale a la carte which was yummy. Our server was great as well. I already can't wait to go back.",yaDSKPoiZe13cCZtAU15vA,2021-12-12 03:48:46,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Chelsea
jlRP816qN_fagMzyuQl5Sg,"I was so excited to try this place. Unfortunately, during an early Tuesday afternoon, service was poor and we could only get 1 out of the 2 drinks we ordered. The bartender was ""missing"" for around 20 minutes before the waitress attempted to make one of our drinks. She tried and I appreciate her effort to fill in where the bartender that was too busy or lost somewhere to care. After 35 mins of the bartender not returning, she returned and offered to try and make a different drink since the bartender couldn't be bothered. We ended our visit short and thanked the waitress for her service. The staffing and service should be worked on STAT in order to give this restaurant a real shot.",KEp7dZII3SmEsvMq0D-OuA,2021-12-21 21:08:46,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,1,Val
GK-CDyuZM1IMqLcJonPEfg,The quesa birria tacos were definitely the star of the show here. They are honestly the best I've ever had. The consome was sooo flavorful. The meat in the tacos was very moist and full of flavor. I left not a single drop of the consome on my plate haha. My best friend and I also decided to give the mini chimis a shot. And we LOVED the bean and cheese mini chimis. We thought we were going too safe but it ended up being a really good decision. The only thing I will say is I wish they would've been a little bit more crispy. But other than that they were delish! I would without a doubt come back and would totally recommend the quesa birria tacos to anyone!,7WGYsN2wn1JfKHmZCP1p0Q,2021-12-13 06:23:47,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,5,Devan
62BHjxwSNvwD82fyNNzqmw,"Came here for my sisters birthday tonight with several family members.  The atmosphere and food was good.  Our service however was sub par.  I've not experienced (and may be due to covid) where you weren't accomodated by a simple request, like lemon for our water.  Or a subsitution in a dish (rice and cheese vice chickpeas in my chili relleno).  Our food arrived and i was handed the wrong dish even when i repeated back to the server what he was giving me. Three of us ordered the same, chilli relleno, wiith mine being the only chicken tinga.  I took two bites before realizing i had shrimp.  So two of us switched dishes.  We continued with our meal and finished, but our table was never cleared by our waitress .  We stacked our dishes to one end of the table, where they sat until we left. We had to have one bill which added an automatic 20% gratuity. Since there were several of us, we had to break down the bill for her and tell her how much we each were paying.",yaydlodjN_42_j74ukIomw,2021-12-31 05:16:43,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,3,Richard
PjHP7aAzNooqUc3ZfrGWJg,This restaurant only has a brunch menu who's is a bit ridiculous for a downtown Tucson restaurant.  The menu was fine otherwise but not a lot of choices that I'm looking for in a lunch.   It took forever to get drinks and they kept sweeping up around tables near us like they were closing and that felt really annoying.   Our waitress did handle a request about ingredients pretty well but she still came back a couple of times to see if my wife would be ok on a substitution.  This was really great but one of those trips should have included the already ordered coke and margarita.,uvIiNOqJQ-3v1YoihwsKYg,2022-01-18 23:38:38,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,2,Randy

J7t2Spm1Qrn_Ujo_fBA7tA,"Was glad that Yelp gave me the ability to join the wait list. Was not happy that my estimated wait was 19 - 36 minutes and we waited for over 1 hour.   They had a DJ for Sunday brunch which was nice. The music was very loud.  We overheard multiple people leaving for this reason. We chose to sit on their patio which was awesome. Although we were looking for the dinner or lunch options, the brunch menu still had a variety to choose from even vegetarian options. Good food, good drinks, and good service will be enough to make me go back for the dinner menu. Birria was ok. Chicken Tinga Chimi's and the Torta..DELICIOUS!",XZc9pY8aMZTWF9zko2qF7Q,2021-12-20 23:45:40,rEeNRMhsz_XMoyFHhcLhxw,3,Chanek
