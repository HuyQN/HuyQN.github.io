wNiUQcic-t7hiY0qDGPsow,We stopped in for breakfast today. The imaginative menu made it difficult to choose what to try on my first visit. Finally I settled on the Mexitartine. Delicious. Filling. I can't wait to get hungry again so I can return and try more dishes.,0Nx2hyGud2txSlM3ZBl-7Q,2022-01-14 21:31:16,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Kit

VC55XMSlOWKfwYCw2H-rcg,"Employees are friendly! It's a nice little restaurant if you want something quick! I ordered the Jardin sandwich which was pretty good! Felt like it was missing something for flavor, maybe hummus or cheese would've helped! Overall, pretty good!",OFIpq4SA3XTEoXWRf5Mahg,2022-01-17 04:51:18,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,3,Danielle
Zc2WYZ8zeYBZ3P5AUdC-DA,The food was great and Michele was really fantastic!  Frida y Diego Chilaquiles has to be the best I've ever had. The eggs were done perfectly and their red and green sauces are perfectly seasoned. Go there and enjoy!!!,oFBxbBdMRo8--CqG2rCPcw,2022-01-17 16:00:44,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Jim
D3YIE8dBEMg-GN5VRbnjiQ,Had a great lunch here. The Diego Rivera chicken sandwich was super tasty. Can't go wrong with a sandwich that includes a chili relleno!  Friendly and quick service too.,2FzJMvli9-BpZ9RDMcD_-Q,2022-01-14 20:30:31,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Michael

p5HNBCMJdDfmkgYVGAuACw,"Very friendly environment, food is good and menu is simple. Prices are fair and everything has a great presentation. Coffee is a bit strong honestly yet its still good. Service is a little slow maybe because its still new but everyone is very friendly. Food came in a good time. No full booths mostly tables some half booth half tables small yet cute decore. I do recommend and will deff come back. Yet I cant really say i recommend a specific dish. Oh also juices are natural! All this for food $57.",yw2h-vqZHzjRTyp1XheUdA,2022-01-15 17:43:24,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,4,Rosa
63-XFrzRAE6BDYkH3oRb5w,"Met a friend for breakfast at Frida's.  She noticed the sign a couple weeks ago and thought we should try it.Oh my goodness!  The food was outstanding!  We both had the MexiTartine.  The flavors were perfect!  I all but licked my plate clean.  My dilemma for next time?  Do I order the same thing since it was so delicious or do I try something else?!  There are so many intriguing items on the menu, I'm sure I will try something else.  I will definitely be back with my husband...soon!The staff was knowledgeable and very friendly.  Very attentive service. I highly recommend eating here!",Du8L_-GsPvOEf-ukEmIUSw,2022-01-14 18:38:01,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Ruth
jfGPLjlLD_LYEyyCemMV1w,"We've been wanting to stop by this new cafe.  It's close to our gym so it's been tempting us for awhile now.  Saturday morning, we finally stopped in.  It's a small cafe that's bright and decorated in vibrant colors with walls adorned by Frida Kahlo prints.  The menu is wonderful.  There were some healthy options, which I appreciate.  There were also some scrumptious sounding options not so good for my diet that I'll have to try on my next visits. I've already told friends how much we enjoyed our dining experience!  The staff was outstanding.  We felt like part of the family.  The food was not only delicious, it was plated nicely as well.  Get the word out on this local business!  You won't be disappointed!",2eOLQcYMjnRnKGZRIFh5MA,2022-01-10 01:05:30,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Karen
OZCRXtF-Vi2KJEIDd17iog,"Our first visit to this newish (five weeks) cafe.  Located in a strip mall so there is ample parking. Was surprised to walk in and see a collection of Frida Kahlo prints and photographs hanging on the dining room walls. The cafe also has a decent sized patio available.  We walked in for breakfast around 8:00 AM and were immediately seated.  Our server was a delightful young lady who was very knowledgeable about the menu items and how those items are prepared.  My wife ordered the Hummingbird Omelete, which comes as a large omelet with spinach, tomatoes, onions, and provolone cheese.  It was accompanied by hashbrowns and grilled sourdough toast.I ordered the Hornitos French toast, which is your basic french toast but made with an egg batter that includes a splash of Hornitos Reposado tequila, accompanied by either link sausage or bacon and sliced melon.  Everything was delicious!  We'll definitely add Frida's to our list of go-to  restaurants.",1lTOxVtP12J6rtdRmfiMPQ,2022-01-17 15:59:35,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Michael
qyYZmXQX5uL0LJeNB4RBgw,"!!!Brunch Alert!!! This little new cafe has some fun Mexican breakfasts, sandwiches, and salads. We tried the Dream Omelette and Chilaqueles and both were delicious. The nice waitress brought us 2 house made salsas: creamy avocado and habanero toasted tomatoes... Flavorful and not too spicy. It has a dog friendly patio on the side.",2jDq1qdBpMexpsf0iDu_rg,2022-01-09 17:20:39,8dZbYgJxNgKd9G3kHWmQ6w,5,Angela
