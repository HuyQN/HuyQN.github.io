5UBXAIENPgP_5SimnVAFmQ,"This restaurant has a fresh Mexican flavor. very clean vibe for the restaurant and Mexico flavor comes out of each dish. cafe de Olla is something you should try, cinnamon and a hint of mexican brown sugar are part of it. Give the empanadas a try. Fun warm pockets of food. Several fillings to choose from. The staff is very friendly and helpful.",5BUo34JwcKyBd7OzbuKuIQ,2021-12-02 22:12:03,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Francisco

YnmG1khM47ClS97nvMh8pg,"This was our first time coming here and if I can give 100 stars I would! The moment you walk in the atmosphere is BEAUTIFUL! You are in Mexico when you are here, with multiple decorations on the roof, to the cute sombrero hats on the wall, to the colorful table cloth on the table. Very clean, beautiful environment. Super comfortable! This place is Comfort Food Heaven! We had the Caffe De Olla , & Sweet Cinnamon Ice Tea. Both of which were PERFECT. I highly recommend having both of these drinks. So rich and delicious :) And then we ordered the Apple Maple Pancakes, Chilla Quells, side of Bacon, and side of Potatoes.When I say these were the BEST pancakes I've ever had I mean it. The fluffy batter to perfection with shaved almonds and shaved maple apples on top I really wanted more. The bacon was cooked perfectly, the potatoes were too addicting and I could have had more. The Chilla Quells were cooked crisp with salsa verda and salsa rojo, which they make in house.Over all this was an amazing experience. The service was amazing too. For how small the dinning room is, our server was amazing. Ask your server how you can get the free desert! I 100% recommend coming here. We plan to come back here as much as we can. The quality of the food is amazing, the environment is so clean and positive. Over all 100+ stars in my books ! :)",aYvmcPtBPdh3egmci5qcKA,2021-12-30 17:35:00,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Goel
XZV8uTzvkrCS7WEz6OMRDw,This is my new favorite brunch spot in Tucson! I have been here two times now & I can't wait to go keep going back. The aesthetic really makes you feel like you are in a little breakfast spot in Mexico. The Mexican coffee is delicious! They bring it out with galletas marias/Mexican cookies & the presentation is so cute! The two dishes I've had are chorizo omelette & chilaquiles divorciados-both were soo good! I've also tried the empanadas and they are delicious! Today I had a taste of the arroz con leche & I definitely recommend as a way to end your breakfast date! The owners are so friendly and kind & go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your time here. The details in the decor makes your dining experience even better! Check them out!!,RQpmBrgQwLif9X7g67jWaA,2021-12-04 21:35:27,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Elena

I will be swinging by 2-3 times a week to nurse a cafe la olla while I wake up for the foreseeable future.",5CAFzjhYaGEewQZuYCTuSw,2021-11-28 18:05:28,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Malcolm
V63rc6sl504uiUg2ZvLZYw,"Oh my gosh, sooo loved this place!! This is run by the old owners of Meztisos, which was another gem shut down by the pandemic.  We just felt good from the moment we walked in, we were greeted warmly, sat down, and given Maria cookies, and delicious homemade chips and salsa!! The sugar was the real Mexican sugar! We ordered Huevos rancheros and chilaquiles divorciados, both just fresh and flavorful, good sized portions, both dishes came with refried beans and my orange juice was fresh squeezed. They also gave us a small portion of rice pudding at the end, it was just perfect.  Absolute best service, highly recommend, and so glad they are back!!",EAHCCgMFoJxlOPcCPQ91SQ,2021-12-20 16:53:13,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Kim
krP8d5p7S8rf6EBhaVNaoA,"Fantastic breakfast spot! The service was very friendly, and the food was delicious. I got huevos rancheros and coffee.

I can't wait to go back and try other things on their menu.",4ARh2zXxxEzlRkpYTtBCPA,2022-01-05 21:08:59,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Lorena

The second visit I got a bean, egg and cheese burrito with a side of rice. Again, the food was excellent. The service is outstanding and it has a great vibe. Highly recommend!",44HQ5x1fvwWNgD4EYU1NjQ,2022-01-14 15:11:31,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Stacy
jnccPnnq0l4NPVjx4lgx1Q,"If you're looking for a meal that tastes homemade, Buendía is just your place. Their food tastes authentic and made with love. Nothing tasted processed or overly salty... Just delicious. I got a cafe de la olla coffee with a nopal huevos rancheros plate. The cafe de la olla had a very strong cinnamon taste and wonderful smell. With the huevos rancheros, I was expecting the nopal to be chopped up in the eggs or salsa but instead, the eggs were placed on top of a whole nopal leaf. I had never had nopal like this before but it was really tasty!! Having the whole leaf allows you to appreciate the nopal a lot more. Overall had a great experience here!",db3nJLBCnVZx9H-wDcYdew,2022-01-10 01:54:54,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Camille
NKj7aa0oysFn_VEsnIRerg,"So this appears to be a new to the area restaurant!  The decor is decidedly south of the border with little flair.  The service is good and the place is very clean.  However the food is unusually fresh and amazingly delish.  Best tortilla soup I've had in Tucson thus far.  They are not quick in service or food prep and it's easy to use this against the place.  But when you get your food, you will smile from ear to ear and the slow delivery will be quickly overlooked.",Ue_b9PgmrrT0gLElBQBuDA,2022-01-15 20:57:17,kxvW5Mfebywb0L1HTHdX3g,5,Dan
