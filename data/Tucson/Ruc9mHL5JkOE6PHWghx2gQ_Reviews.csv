TqFXPgxpxMq9Mj-dKz50DQ,"I browsed the menus online before arriving, there were about 4 different food menus. When we showed up the hostess said the bar bites and taco menu was available at the far bar area (there are 2 bars). The place is huge! We shared carne asada tacos, yucca fries and the fried goat cheese salad. The food was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend the yucca fries. I'm taking one star away for the service. It was open seating in the bar and it took a long time for us to be acknowledged. One of the bartenders said he'd bring menus but never did. The other bartender eventually came to our table and got us taken care of. For how not busy it was, the service was not great. There was a band setting up who started playing when we were leaving. Don't forget to ask the front desk for a double tree cookie ;).",yaDSKPoiZe13cCZtAU15vA,2021-06-06 13:07:38,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,4,Chelsea
7EXQcD3gyjoAHlKayy8AYw,"I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place!!  This was the most outstanding service I've had in a long time!  Steven was funny and absolutely great with our large group!  He made sure ever detail was taken care of for us.  The food came out so fast for us being such a large party, checks were perfectly right, drinks well coordinated.  Just everything on point!  The food was equally as amazing!  The guac - so fresh and delicious with pepitas and microgreens on the top, my El Mez burger - fantastic!  The omelet of day looked over the top, with roast beef and Au Jus, and the mole short ribs - also beautifully presented!  Saturday and Sunday are brunch only.  All of the menu options looked great, and it was hard to decide on something!  It was a rainy day otherwise, we would have sat outside on the beautiful patio!!  Inside was also great with super comfy chairs!  5 star experience all the way!",EAHCCgMFoJxlOPcCPQ91SQ,2021-07-27 16:11:51,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Kim
YTt3EMVKNku1NhR3pwLdGg,"This place is fantastic! Stumbled upon it looking for the best margarita and this place popped up. Drinks are so delicious ( Alex was our bartender) just ask her and she will make any drink you wish custom made to your liking. Everything from chips & salsa, salad, wings, skirt steak were all DELICIOUS! The wings are a must! Crunchy and tasty! The steak is so tender. The total experience was so satisfying from the the moment we walked in until we left. Everyone greeted us, the manager came over to our table to check on us, our waiter was amazing and I already mentioned Alex, I would really recommend this place, a MUST TRY at least one! ( This visit was on July 23rd 2021) We will DEFINITELY be returning!",ETNPbsL6naWuuc5A_KXtTg,2021-08-13 16:58:18,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Sand J
-3q2rL_TmVALyIfreYknyA,"Delish! We came here after a long drive from Flagstaff. We got dressed up and came for dinner. We didn't realize it was in the hotel initially. The layout is large and the ambiance is classy and approachable with nice decorative touches everywhere. We sat on the patio. The cocktails were great. I got a margarita and my partner bravely tried the spicy heaven or hell cocktail. Great flavors in both. We were hungry and ordered too much food. The portion sizes are ample and do not need a side. We each ordered an entree and a side. The vegetarian flautas were wonderful. Very flavorful with a great presentation over rice and beans. I asked for spicy sauce (because I always need spicy sauce) and it was a great addition. I probably should have got a side salad instead of papas bravas to balance the meal. My partner got the short ribs mole. It was HUGE! Served over a bed of yucca and other vegetables. We also got a side of rice and beans and the papas bravas. The papas bravas were good, but the plantain was a bit dry so we asked for a side of sauce. It was a really wonderful meal. The servers are all attentive, friendly, and professional. The atmosphere is spot on and the food is wonderful. I highly recommend.",5aRYlIChJKoT2_FMS-ZGVw,2021-05-31 04:16:13,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Jasmine
J9j30yNw6s4SmNNkEpOXoQ,"So sad - we actually liked this restaurant but probably will not return anytime soon as it is on the pricy side and we did not have a good experience last night. My husband and I have dined there several times and each time we ordered 2 tacos each, cocktails, and 2 side dishes to share.  We also brought friends with us on one occasion and our group spent a decent amount.  When we decided to eat there last night, the staff informed us that they got rid of the taco menu because people were ""taking advantage"" of it and not ordering from their more expensive entree menu.  They were not very busy for a Saturday night, with only a handful of tables.  We took our business elsewhere.  Their loss...",G3eOniheI0tWUAwr622vhA,2021-09-05 15:00:35,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,4,Rose
ckdjQ-qZ63wpzkr0_20-VQ,"A group of us tried El Mezquite for happy hour.  The interior design of all of the restaurant spaces is very cool.  Besides the restaurant, there is a bar area (had live music) and lots of patio space, some with misters, some without.  Good menu choices for drinks and small plates.  This was a Saturday so eventually it became busy, but tables are spaced well, and servers were masked.  We all agreed to come back at a later date and explore the dinner menu. Special shout-out to Evyn and Kristen for their excellent hospitality!",daNpohF2Nj07qyymqWSf4A,2021-09-20 18:47:43,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Mary
kLmRSeSTkCIybFbpcX0KcQ,"Sweeping hand over head! Yes! This place opening truly flew right over my head. I watched the building of this hotel week in and out. I even watch them set up the beds in the rooms as I could see the mattress propped up in the windows. So I must have dosed off into the Land of Almost Awake ( or Asleep obviously in my case), because I missed the restaurant's opening by a month! Had no idea the were open until there was chalk board for it on the sidewalk. Praise the board!!! Love the board. Brought my mom with me on the morning walk and breezed in with the Spring air. The patio is huge. Made social distancing easy. With newly attached glare- defying, shade providing umbrellas the tables are magnificent for enjoying outdoor dining. Food! After all, enjoying the Spring breeze is only made better by the smell of sweet bread baking, or better: bacon! I can say that even though I'm vegetarian. There's something about bacon that is fundamentally delicious smelling. Mom and split an omelette with all veggies fillings, that comes with English muffin and we selected the home potato (best choice of the morning). Get the home potato. I could not encourage you more. These are well seasoned, crunchy, crispy pillows of potato mundane-ly named home potato. Please order the perfect potato pillows.Our servers were a delight. We had servers because their was a mix up in communication who were were assigned to but both did their best for us and in the end we came out the winners. They were friendly, professional and extra helpful.",Uy1iRW4xze56vhzFYAo-tw,2021-04-24 21:14:51,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Queen
4gEM5PMTGPu5RF6LJnqIRA,"We'd hesitated to try this place, given the corporate hotel location, but a strong recommendation from a local friend encouraged us. Yes, it's a bit pricy -- and prices have clearly gone up from their opening menu. But what we had was superb, and the service great despite the clear challenges they (and many other restaurants) are having in finding staff. This has limited their ability to seat many people despite the size of the place. But on to the food....We understand that they have pared back the original menu quite a bit (disappointing initially, as some of the items no longer available sounded great) but that isn't necessarily a big issue given the staffing challenges. Better to have fewer, well prepared items than more, less well made.We had some excellent guacamole to start, and the chips were clearly freshly made. The truffled cheese crisp was huge and so very flavorful with just the right amount of truffle oil and arugula to add to the cheeses and very good tortilla base.The wild Mexican shrimp skewer was epic. 6 huge, extremely fresh shrimp grilled over meszquite with grilled lemon as well. These were served with a side swath of very tasty -- although quite spicy -- thick salsa a chili arbol and peanuts. Also included were housemade corn tortillas, rice and some nicely seasoned black beans.",J1zvCn7t7Vww5-9ADrL5qg,2021-11-13 00:45:28,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,4,Joan
UDynKC9ZpvzLvGjfjdErUA,"Love the way they have done this place from the beautiful bar area with green quartz going all the way up the walls illuminated from the backside-gorgeous! To the beautiful outside patio-just lovely! Then there's the food! First try the stuffed peppers-stuffed with crab, cheese, then wrapped with bacon! Truly delicious! For dinner you must try the Duck-Pato de something or other just ask...it's  totally rockin'! The other incredibly delicious entree is the Short Ribs! Slow cooked YUM! The Chef is one of Tucson's Best! Go NOW before the word get's out and have a totally delicious time!!!! They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner! And the menu for the breakfast and lunch looked great too! We were there only for dinner.",UKi083DTL40b8Eyh5jh3OQ,2021-05-01 08:28:52,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Aidea
H2uXvg4dIP8h1oVjzt8U-Q,I had breakfast here and they had teas available for purchase which is nice and I went with a green tea and ordered el mez breakfast.  I opted for the english muffin and like that they serve cage free eggs.  The service is polite and nice.   I would of liked my english muffin toastier but that is my preference but still a good place for breakfast and they open at 6a for early birds like me.,W9MPolPlUiUEXYfGnYiHEQ,2021-07-25 16:41:36,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,4,Violeta
x7X_dHMrBQK_DWNqNreWkw,We stayed at the hotel and had a late dinner here. It was a Monday night and the restaurant didn't have a single customer so I was expecting an overpriced hotel meal. I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food here. The cheese crisp flat bread was delicious and the short rib mole was to die for. The short rib was crispy on the outside and fall apart tender on the inside. Flavorful veggies and yucca. If I lived in Tuscan I'd come back for it. :),j7t3AbJla8R1MqPitlz60g,2021-12-28 11:54:11,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Jennifer

apPWIW3WEI3on48dBtbjSQ,"Mmmmmmmm. The food here is just ok. Really basic. I had way higher expectations based on their reviews which is how I found this place and decided to try it. I feel like the reviews must be people who work there. It didn't even come close to meeting my expectations . The rice and beans are extremely basic and lack flavor, the rice kind of a hard texture. I had the coconut crusted snapper which was 32 dollars and it was nothing special nor a large portion or worth ever coming back for unfortunately. Everything tasted like it was drenched in butter and I suspect it was. The kids menu was not that great either, why not just have something like tacos with beans and rice for kids? I had a hard time feeding my daughter anything somewhat decent here.",pdKV8bzFP0itnRPzL0nhOQ,2021-11-22 20:51:02,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,2,Vanessa
7VbhaCeMM1AiEcCWpwcUrQ,"We came here for Sonoran Restaurant Week and were very excited to try this place out. I have not been this disappointed in a long time. In fact, I've stopped writing bad reviews because I don't want to put negativity out there...but this place demands that I do. First off, the decorations and vibe are completely off. No life whatsoever. It looks like a conference room with hotel room lamps. This is a Mexican restaurant? Where's the soul? The mariachis cannot cover up the complete lack of personality. As bad as the interior is, the food is even worse. We had the Sonoran restaurant week specials and both of them under delivered. The appetizers were fine. She liked the gazpacho, I enjoyed the caramelos. It was the mains that ruined the complete meal. The ""enchiladas"" were bland and basically just tortillas and sauce, no filling. No heat, no seasoning. They were cut into one inch disks and covered up with a heavy sauce and mixed salad greens AND a fried egg. WTF? The spare ribs were tasteless, tough and hard to cut. It was accompanied by tortillas and poorly cooked potatoes. Why? Why were there grapes on the plate too? The dish made absolutely no sense and tasted awful. They hint towards mexican flavors but there is no heat, no spice, no life! NO MAS! We sent both dishes back. To replace them, we asked for the guacamole and the grilled chicken wings. These restaurant staples had to be better right? Oh come on, you already know they weren't. The guacamole had micro greens and pomegranate seeds in it. WHY? They added NOTHING to the already bland guac. Good guacamole is not hard to make, but these guys proved me wrong. The grilled chicken wings saved the day though...just kidding. If you want good grilled wings, go to Daisy Maes. Shit, I've had better wings from the frozen food aisle. The pre-fixed meals come with a desert but we had had enough and said no thanks. Just the check please. With all that said, they were understaffed but did their very best. Our waiter was very friendly and responsive. The manager was understanding and took off the main entrees off our bill. For that I give them a second star.",XzgLFg8r_BvwEYJeZB0t-w,2021-09-18 17:27:35,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,2,Nick

Beautiful one month old hotel I would stay in,  In a second. Do note the Main Fire Dept faces the SW Corner and there could be some big city noise. We had beer, drinks and tacos.

i_cFImFby6aRnGuZl483Jg,"In a city known for its food, this restaurant was a standout. It started with an exceptional guacamole appetizer.  We order guacamole every where we go because we love it, but this restaurant took it to a whole new level. Served with pumpkin and pomegranate seeds, and a side of fresh chips, we could have just had that and ended the meal happy. The generous serving was more than enough for two people. Our entrees, roasted chicken and duck were perfect. The Chef's skill at marrying flavors really elevated each dish. Just when we thought  the meal couldn't get any better, the flan for dessert was the thing of dreams. Perfect texture, not too sweet, and topped with fresh whipped cream dusted with lemon zest. It was served with a delicious ginger cookie on the side. It is now the benchmark in my life to which all flans will be compared. Service was excellent, and the indoor outdoor seating options were great. If you are looking for a wonderful night out, I would highly recommend.",SI4P5F5QhUgP3XGPyHj-7A,2021-04-01 04:16:53,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Bari

4760xGxdDRe6inEvex-uSQ,"What a beautiful new space downtown!  And I mean beautiful in all the ways a place can be beautiful. The hospitality was fantastic, from the service to the knowledge about the menu to special requests. The atmosphere was great, and they have live music every night!  At first it didn't seem like they had a lot of vegan options, but it turned out that numerous dishes already on the menu were very easy to make vegan (and gluten free, by the way, if you need it), the portions were enormous, and our server was excellent. I had the best yucca I've ever had in my life there, and the cauliflower chicharrones were so good. Other offerings at our table were great guacamole, a truffled cheese crisp (yes, you read that right), great entrees easily large enough to share, and a friend enjoyed his steak immensely. It was a slow night when we were there, and we heard the other tables oohing and aahing over their food too, clearly enjoying it all. And the Mariachis were world class. They have a good variety of live music from locals we love, so we will definitely be frequenting this new gem!  The only thing I didn't like was my mixed drink. It was called a Mayan Warrior and featured Mezcal, but what it ended up being was a sweet tiki drink (in a tiki mug no less), which was not what we expected at all.  They have a fantastic selection of local beers and great wine, and this happened to be the only drink our server hadn't tried, so it was just a random disappointment, but I definitely wouldn't recommend it, and think the name, ingredients, and presentation were just...not cohesive.  Again, though, everything else was fantastic and other people liked their drinks, so I'd still rate the experience as top-notch. At first I was worried about competition from a corporate kitchen being a death knell to The Coronet, which has really been struggling lately (in many ways), but then I learned that the chef at El Mezquite is Ginny Wooters from The Abbey and Jax Kitchen. No wonder it's so fantastic!  I was really happy to see such a great local talent tapped to run this place.  She's a star and has obviously brought her immense talent, creativity, and generosity of spirit to this new and vibrant downtown gem.",Z6kmV2B3oe9bHqvxn9uzuQ,2021-06-11 16:01:16,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Eric
TppIMSMbeU3iFuffPUdVVQ,"High expectations for this relatively new restaurant in a great downtown location. Atmosphere definitely felt like a hotel restaurant, especially the lighting which was too bright. Friendly service, but wait time for entrees and check were uncomfortably long. The food was good, although too much cilantro in everything and specialty short rib mole a very heavy combination. Not a good value--prices were too high for the combination of benefits--$130 before tip with one of us not drinking.

Our first clue should have been that almost all other participating restaurants were completely booked but this one had open times galore. I do wish that they disclosed on their website that its a hotel restaurant and probably a coffee shop during the day. As others have said, there is no real ambiance to speak of. Service was terrible, food was terrible. The reason for the second star is that the manager reduced our bill by half when we told him how bad everything was.

bphcV_QYArzzFcH7Y6s-JA,"Because of the lack of options on Christmas Day, we decided to try this place after church.  I've had their bar food before (wings and quesadillas) and they were not bad.  Service was awful.  The hotel staff had to convince the server to take us for lunch at 1pm.  I could overhear the server arguing with the hotel staff that she wants to close.  She turned away another diner and noted, ""we have a life too"".  I realize it's Christmas, but why be at work?  The food was bland.  We had the breakfast bowl (black beans were not seasoned), churro French toast (not bad), el mez burger (no seasoning), and mole tosta (dry meat).  I do like this hotel, but I will certainly avoid going to this restaurant with this level of service.

The restaurant is nice and the patio is ideal, in all the location is nice.Drinks, I had a Lavender G&T, it was very good. Presentation, taste and serving size was great!My daughters ordered some type of lemonade that was flavored, it was horrible. Food, we ordered Guacamole, it was good but I'd hold off on the pomegranate. Chips and salsa, chips where good, salsa lacked flavor. Toritos were good, perfectly cooked bacon and the goat cheese was good too.Loaded fries where not what I expected but they weren't horrible, I wouldn't order them again.  Now the burger was good, the Gouda cheese was the icing on the cake. Yucca fries where nothing special. 2 carne asada taco, with a 1oz side of salsa where ok. The meat had no seasoning at all and was a little over cooked. I just poured a lot of salsa, squeezed some lime and added some guacamole and they were fine. I would not order them again.  In all it's not a great place, just average for this visit. I will try it again and order different items. We really enjoyed the live band on the patio and the drinks.

HVMN3ptKVCPafzUOvPCZvg,"My friend and I wanted to check out what Chef Ginny Wooters was dishing up at the recently opened space in the Doubletree Hilton adjacent to the Tucson Convention Center. Wooters exceeded our expectations, as did many other details of the eclectically decorated space. Large indoor and outdoor seating options can easily accommodate large parties, but one of the most remarkable details I noticed immediately upon being seated was the comfort of the chairs in the main dining room. As a veteran of two spine fusions, comfortable dining furniture is often overlooked in most restaurants. The four top offered rounded, fully-backed upholstered chairs with ample cushioning making our 2 1/2 hour dining experience extremely enjoyable and comfortable. Both my friend and I are small in stature, and our feet could easily reach the floor. I wish more restaurants would invest in comfortable, upholstered chairs for diners instead of hard wooden seats.We started off with Steak Tartare and Toritos Cangrejos. The Tartare was accompanied by an array of escabeche vegetables and chimichurri, all to be devoured with fried plantain strips. Both the escabeche vegetables and chimichurri were outstanding, and we asked for more chimichurri as the portion on the plate was a little scarce. The server quickly delivered. Each element on this plate complimented the raw beef perfectly with acidity and color, and I could have easily gone for another side of the vegetables solo, but I had to pace myself. The Toritos are three bacon-wrapped fresh Caribe Chiles stuffed with herbed goat cheese over a bright yellow Cholula-lime aioli. I've never had a Caribe Chile before, and I am now a huge fan. My friend mentioned shying away from anything bacon wrapped, but this dish was sublime. The bacon was not only perfectly cooked, but it was also thinly sliced so it was crisp-tender and didn't overtake the dish. The fresh Caribe Chile and creamy goat cheese were the star, and the sauce offered a perfectly acidic, bright yellow contrast. The entrees: Confit Pata de Pato (Duck) and Coconut-Crusted Snapper. My duck was cooked perfectly and sat over a chipotle-agave glaze. Although the sauce was sweet, there was nice bite from the chipotle Chile at the finish. It came with thickly sliced plantains, halved baby potatoes, Torino pork (lardons) with sautéed kale. Every element was complimentary, but the plantains were a bit woody and hard, maybe a tad underripe - my only disappointment. My friend's snapper was to die for, served with cauliflower chicharrones, dates, sautéed kale, piñon nuts over a lemon-manchego cream. The snapper was crusted and cooked perfectly - flaky, tender and MOIST! Don't skip this dish. It's beautiful and elegant.We were stuffed, but I had to order a dessert, so we tried the lemon-coconut flan. This was a flan like neither one of us had ever had. The texture was very firm unlike most flans, but the creamy texture was smooth and very refined, almost like a crème brulée, but stiffer texture. There was more of a hint of lemon than coconut, and both flavors were extremely subtle. It came with fresh berries, whipped cream, and very large gingerbread cookie in the shape of a pig. The cookie was a subtle gingerbread, but a bit thick and dry, and I could only eat half. The sauce was very good, but can't for the life of me remember what it was. A reminder to snap the menus so I have them for reference.They have live mariachi music, but it's not your standard mariachi. They sang and played some American songs as well, and their music was extremely enjoyable. They were packing up as we were leaving, and the guitar player was strumming a Led Zeppelin tune before casing his instrument. I couldn't remember the name of the song, so after guessing its name and album it was on, he played a few riffs of different Zeppelin songs for a continued guessing game. Just a nice, unexpected end to the evening. Will definitely return to try the other outstanding items on this menu - there are many to choose from. Vegan diners are welcome here. Chef Wooters never disappoints since her debut at McClintock's at Saguaro Ranch many moons ago, then moving on to Jax, The Abbey, Jackson Kitchen, Commoner and Co., and Alloro AOC and the Hilton East. Her thoughtful array of ingredients, colors, sauces, and plating have only elevated over the years and I have always been a huge fan of her food. She definitely made this a meal to remember. This space is open for breakfast, lunch and dinner. Can't wait to return.",XyD_NQoeZWFIjZ7F1Cvqlw,2021-07-03 16:43:25,Ruc9mHL5JkOE6PHWghx2gQ,5,Jane
