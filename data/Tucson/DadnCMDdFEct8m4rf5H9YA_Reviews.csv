0KqMjgQX3DFAhs7sfzf4GQ,"This is my second time coming to the jackrabbit. The vibe inside is great and the food and drink are good. We love the jackrabbit signature. HOWEVER, the house music on Saturday's.... Sucks. This place is pretty big but was not nearly full . I 100% suspect it's the DJ. He seems like a great guy, he's clean cut and chill. But the music is so repetitive and makes you want to leave. Music on Saturday's should be upbeat and make me want to dance! The beats Jackrabbit play hurts my ears :-(",4zE-SsC7vVd-BffNssI2Gg,2021-12-19 07:09:51,DadnCMDdFEct8m4rf5H9YA,3,Camryn

They cook and mix cocktails like they've got something to prove, and I am here for it. Definitely coming back.",aA5opMba2VhElUNffvxZWg,2021-12-16 20:10:01,DadnCMDdFEct8m4rf5H9YA,5,Isaiah

-xOYyaypnRNcFnVUWayMuA,"Stopped in to see what the new concept for the building is and I love it. The ambience is beautiful, dark, and moody with some fun little jackrabbit neon lights. Hannah was behind the bar and she was excellent. Attentive, friendly, can certainly mix a great cocktail, and full of great insights and recommendations for first timers. They are still looking to get staffed up for their kitchen, so the wait on food was longer than some might care for, but I believe the flavors are worth the wait. The deviled eggs were plated beautifully and tasted just as good. The sandwiches were good as well, the patty melt was pretty decent while the chicken sandwich was very flavor packed. Full disclosure, the sauce was burnt the first time around but they were very friendly in getting it fixed for me  I was appreciative  The fries are steak fries which are okay but are not our favorites. If they're seasoned they're a bit overly spicy and if you hold the spicy seasoning then they come out quite plain. Overall it was a pleasing experienceThe drinks are delicious and very well made, lots of options available and they all appear worth a try. We tried the whiskey Sour, Mai Tai, and creamsickle and there were no regrets in those choices. This is not a place I can come to often, this is definitely more upscale than what had been here before and it is reflected in the prices. The outer facade doesn't do the interior justice. I think it's a great scene for a date night or meet up with friends. They've got karaoke on Thursday and DJs Weds and Sunday, Sunday is also S.I.N., so service industry get a discount. Honestly, I would say 4.5/5 if I could but, again they're still staffing up and ironing out some kinks. They were missing a beer advertised on their menu (a favorite of mine) and the wait time for food was a bit too long so 4/5 is fair. Certainly looking forward to coming back again.",8MkZ6bpdP7x8Vlm_uEWDqw,2021-09-19 03:12:17,DadnCMDdFEct8m4rf5H9YA,4,Ivan
