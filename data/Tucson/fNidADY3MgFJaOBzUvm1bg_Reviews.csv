We have found with any of the restaurants we've gone to for take out during covid we make sure to be there early for pickup to make sure food is hot. Some of our favorites are the burgers, the Southwest Egg-roll, stir fry bowls.Have set outside and service can be a little slow, and server needed to be reminded a couple of times about an order I was taking home for husband. All in  all we have been happy with the take out service and happy to have a restaurant that takes a few minutes to walk to onsite.",IC9YBFkSEhkAIfvff6-rQA,2021-03-29 14:28:51,fNidADY3MgFJaOBzUvm1bg,4,Maxine

FJwWdiW5uynwnIl9efPVyA,"This is our favorite spot since moving to south Tucson! They are friendly and the food is good. Best time to go is Happy Hour M-F from 3-6 p.m. for drink and appetizer specials. Our other favorite days are Monday, Burger Day - $7.00 burgers with purchase of any beverage (non-alcoholic or alcoholic). Don't miss Taco Tuesday where $2.50 beef or chicken or fish tacos rein supreme. Try their Fat Willy's Lager for a real cold treat on a HOT summer day!",zvVwEJdAxmddapwnd2wI1w,2021-06-19 01:51:44,fNidADY3MgFJaOBzUvm1bg,5,Lempe

Thought we would give it another shot since it's under new management.  Same long wait!*5:25 placed drink order asked for menus after I flagged down waitress.  *5:35 oredred drinks/got menus*6:25 ordered after I flagged down waitress*7:05   Food came7:27 bill7:29 paid checkPeople next to us ordered Same drinks they did last night.  Said it was $20 last night and $33 tonight. The problem..... They ordered during happy hour and didn't get it for half an hour.  Not their fault.  We had 4 different waitresses.  Not sure what was going on.  We were never offered another drink or asked how the food was.  Surprisingly it was hot.  Great food but I value my time more.  Don't recommend!",ACMYTmlycF2-HgSZ8lyC0A,2021-02-23 03:09:00,fNidADY3MgFJaOBzUvm1bg,2,Lisa
Iuneja7oAe1wWJky0hceXw,"We have eaten here several times as we are staying in the RV park. Excellent menu, lots to choose from, and lots of appetizers. Some food items are excellent--the potato skins are delicious, garnished with very green lettuce strips--yum! and they have new menu items that we are going to try--steak tips Gorgonzola for one. The fish and chips is meh....I ordered a steak extra rare and it came out medium rare. Sent it back and it came back the second time still not rare enough. Guess they don't think I really want to eat extra rare meat! Mashed potatoes were very lumpy but served with delicious gravy. The steak didn't have much taste to it. We ordered the beef nachos and it was a BIG serving, enough for two, with delicious homemade salsa. The chips were fresh and crispy. They have cheese curds on the new menu but they are frozen, not fresh. Breakfast items are terrific--biscuits and sausage gravy, the breakfast wrap. More than once, our orders came out served lukewarm. Kitchen staff needs to communicate food is ready to servers, or servers need to check in with the kitchen more frequently. Service is very slow every time we have been there. So over all, the restaurant Nees to improve but we will continue to visit the restaurant and try various items as it is super convenient!",EpHaaDmOaKmKadHRvfTd4A,2022-01-09 01:59:32,fNidADY3MgFJaOBzUvm1bg,4,Jeanne
