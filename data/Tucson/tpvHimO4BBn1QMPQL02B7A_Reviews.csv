m-rDdKgd3vaEBWjxpQOZXA,"Delicious! We got the ""el rio"" chicken tostada and the ""Pueblo quesabirria"" sandwich. Both were 10/10. Great flavors, textures, and portion size. I'm excited to go back and try more items!",o4Kaz7ROzKHwUs1Y-dnk6Q,2021-01-14 21:28:11,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Marissa

J3YCUxZuAUwzEq2G4LGyow,"I absolutely love every charro concept and barrio bread is a local favorite. I was really hoping this would live up the the hype! I had the Rincón Relleno and it was just ok. The bread was burned, not much flavor, and for $10 I just felt like it wasn't worth it. I left with two $5 bags of chips for friends and family, but probably won't be trying this place again for the price. I love supporting local but I'd rather go to El Charro and enjoy a carne seca filled relleno!",TooOXvtHzJbNmcZKigI30w,2021-03-17 19:49:24,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,3,Briana
16BPCaN5jNHgFa04KMK7tQ,"Was looking forward to this visit but I was very disappointed. Order at the counter and sit in an uncomfortable metal chair if you can find one, no names are taken to help with seating. The Panchilada is bread pieces with a sauce, cheese and cilantro served in a take home aluminum plate with no garnish or sides. They forgot the chicken; no apologies or comment when I took it to the counter. Flavor was unremarkable. The optional small amount of chicken brought it to $12. Staff not friendly or welcoming. You have to ask for the location of the water and utensils. Tables are not wiped between customers, bus your own table. The food and other products for sale are very overpriced. If they don't change they don't deserve to stay in business.",ptS2nrDvyvsu-W0yi567EA,2021-05-21 22:53:46,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,1,Gloria

nzcgXfYHAP6tUqgsdD99vw,"If you love Barrio Bread, make way for Barrio Charro. This place has some amazing sandwiches on their signature bread, Tortamanos is where it's at. Their most popular is the carne asada one and I can definitely see why. Generous portions, delicious flavors, and made with love. This place is such a great addition to the Old Pueblo. It is always busy but don't let that deter you! There is plenty of parking and you can always get your grub to go.

e2YXwbHrRQI2SoD_TnI1hQ,The three stars is for the Cabrini Cubano. The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly and helpful. I have to preface this review with I have spent a fair amount of time in Tampa and the Cubano is my favorite sandwich style. The Cabrini Cubano tastes good. UT not like a Cubano.  The bread is good but not flattered on the plancha so you don't get that crunch. It seems underfilled and not quite the right flavors.,Y2vmE74kkYH27Q9k8TJ2Dg,2021-08-02 18:15:05,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,3,Tom
WjGPX6Z9zmpys2b8FKVZ5w,"Wow. Not sure why it took me this long to come here. This place is equal parts ""you know what you're getting"" and ""holy shit this was better than I was expecting"". I love Barrio Bread, like charro's food (charro steak to be specific). Barrio Charro is an excellent combination of each company's strengths with none of the weaknesses. I had the carne asada sandwich, she had the sunny side tortamano. Hers was delicious, mine was dearlordhowdidtheymakethis? delicious. The first bite made me do a Guy Fierri eye roll and  declare that it was ""gangster"". I will be coming back for this sandwich and it stands no chance against the furry my hungry stomach holds. The coffee is good too. Get the cafe de la olla and taste some coffee that is hilariously yummy. One negative...those stools at the high top (picture included). They are legit the worst stools I've ever sat on. I saw three different groups sit on them and then move to a table.

p79sT-mWZSgTUxw0D8Xf9A,"Funny how things happen. I was actually looking for ""Tucson Tea company"" because I was trying to be the kind person and support a new business. However, on Yelp! (At least at this time) both establishments have the same address for whatever reason so I ended up at this place instead! Barrio Charro served me some Wonderrrrrrful Tres Leches cake. It's made with cane sugar which is important to me. They have a vanilla option and a coconut option which they're both basically the same except the coconut one has coconut sprinkled on top. My husband is on a keto diet so I hope he doesn't read this review since I'm being ""supportive"". I had no intention of getting this delicious cake. I just wanted a coffee and perhaps some sort of savory item. But I saw the cake, and my inner Marie-Antoinette said ""eat the cake!"" I don't know, this cake with a coffee...it was a pretty amazing combination. I'm not one to eat anything if I don't absolutely love it; I practically licked the container when I was finished! Definitely worth it if you are really in the mood for a big piece of delicious, good quality cake and a hot beverage! It's interesting about Tres Leches...it's good to keep in mind that this type of cake is somehow dry and moist at the same time which I find absolutely amazing! I believe that's the way it's ""supposed to be"" so it's perfect with a beverage. They had two types of drip coffee. One was a French roast and the one I tried started with a letter O. I'm not sure what it was. I thought it said ""Café Olé"" on the carafe but it was definitely black coffee so it must've said some other fancy word. It had this delicious, sweet, cinnamon aftertaste! $10 for the drip coffee and the cake which is pretty steep in my book, but I'm glad I tried it at least once!",EAYRQGbCV9RcP6cRow95WQ,2021-06-29 20:15:32,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Lily
5zeCVTFmVVuglStVzS6kFA,"Second time being takeout from here and was prepared to give it 5 stars, alas that is no longer the case. Today, I ordered the refried beans as my side (I had had them before on one of the toasts) - much to my surprise, there was meat in the refried beans. This is great for most people, but I'm a vegetarian, so not the greatest. They do not explicitly state this on their menu, nor does their online ordering system give any sort of indication that this is the case. Now, I normally wouldn't reduce a rating because of this, but when I had ordered the toast my first time (in person), I had explicitly asked if the toast I was ordering had any meat as I was a vegetarian, and the woman taking my order said no. I couldn't figure out why it has destroyed my stomach until this time. Don't get me wrong - overall, their food is fantastic. I just wish they made it more explicit that their refried beans have meat or trained their people better to know what's in the food. It could've saved me a lot of digestive grief.",IRc32xCXlHDQjezcG5jj2Q,2021-04-04 20:17:19,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,3,Valerie

All the deliciousness you'd expect from Charro paired with  amazing Barrio bread. Highlight here is if you didn't get your fill from your meal they have an extensive shop of bread, tortillas and pre-made foods. They are currently only doing to go and patio seating.

We had a couple breakfast sandwiches and enjoyed them thoroughly. All ingredients were good but we especially loved the bread.Price: I suppose it's a little bit on the pricier side for this particular meal.

vBJsCKG5HNEe3wowoo81vQ,"This new Barrio Charro restaurant is larger than I thought, beautifully designed with lots of open space.  We did a to-go order for two sandwiches (tortas, or Tortamanos as they call them here):  the Pueblo Quesabirria and the Armando's Asada.  Both were absolutely delicious.  Amazing Azteca bread from award-winning baker Don Guerra sandwiches the delicious fillings.  The birria was spot-on perfect, with a little bit of spice, and generously portioned.  The dipping sauce (consome') was awesome.  The carne asada sandwich (I had a taste!) was exquisite.  Again, the sumptuous bread for the sandwich paired well with a fantastic creamy avocado and Oaxacan queso with tender chunks of grilled beef (grass fed!).  although it's a new place that just opened, the teaming of master chef Carlotta Flores (and Si Charro!'s legendary expertise) and Guerra's wildly-renowned Barrio Bread has clearly assured that they could roll out this new concept quite smoothly.  They have grab-and-go display areas for breads and salsas and tamales and sides, and a large menu that will bring me back here again and again for fast casual to-go, supporting local businesses serving up fresh and creative food.  I just hope they can expand their hours, because this place is going to be a big hit!",17d89j4lqveyVHG7718szA,2021-01-17 01:41:20,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Scott
aK9b3blZad5NI_MO5DK-GQ,"Was really excited to try this place after all the raving reviews, however I don't feel like it lives up to the hype. The restaurant itself is set up lovely, although it's pretty much the same layout as the Hawaiian place that was here before. I appreciate how spacious the set up is to allow for social distancing. I placed a to go order for two sandwiches, the asada and the flowing wells, and the el rio tostada. I ended up waiting 30 minutes for the order, which is fine because it's a pandemic and all. Drove another 20 minutes home ready to devour these sandwiches. The presentation was beautiful, but after a couple of bites I learned the barrio bread was the best part of the sandwich. The meat for the sandwiches was scarce and not flavorful -- not authentic to Sonoran Mexican food at all. I'm hoping it was just what I ordered, and will give this place another try. As for now, if I want a Mexican torta I'll stick to the carnicería down the street.",2ASSfvbV7lPeqbQlWQgMVA,2021-03-07 15:47:54,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,3,Moe

I was really looking forward to this amazing partnership, but I can't recommend this new venture to anyone in its present form. It was so disappointing, minuscule, burned pieces of toast with some mashed avocado on top for almost $10 each! And, even though it was listed on the chit, my order was completely absent. There are so many places you can go for amazing avocado toast, but this is not one of them.

-rBvzcqP6i2X0stNz-amqg,"Huge fan of the food but their takeout takes FOREVER. 30 min to make 3 sandwiches and it still wasn't ready. I was able to write this review and file a complaint with the manager and our food still wasn't ready. 4 other take out orders were done before us. The staff wasn't even apologetic and just defensive that their IT system isn't set up for a speedy online order.  At least their manager was responsive.  However, their manager also stated that it is ""just the way"" their IT system is set up. Ridiculous. It is hugely disappointing. Service shouldn't be based on what your IT system is set up for but rather the customers in front of you and the order in which tickets come in.  Don't ever order an order online if you want it quickly.Update: we got home and our order was incomplete: missing sides, not cut...it was like they were waiting till the 30 min mark to start the order and then was scrambling at the end because of our complaints",EJUg3NVEeTxYdaFPU5kGGQ,2021-11-06 18:13:13,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,1,Nancy

1QXCfWpne29Zv_mPdEb8-A,"I would give this place one star if it was not for the Broadmoor melt.Parking is pretty easy even though really busy inside with this new collaboration restaurant. Clean inside and decent area that has bread, salsas and a view of the kitchen which that transparency is always refreshing. Ordered the fairgrounds salad which almost is a Waldorf without anything that makes it as tasty. Chicken chunks are palletable and the greens are fresh but you may as well go around the corner to Safeway and get something from the deli or even trader Joe's 5 minutes north and save the money and bother. The carlottas Catalina had decent beans, undercooked potatoes and they did not add my paid/charged for chicken. I understand this happens for take out sometimes but it is quite a shame when you try to call and get a busy signal - many attempts tried over. Left a message for the manager and will see where that goes but after a 55 dollar three person meal I suspect it is just settled on my disappointment and note here. Tamale is tasty and comparable to food city parking lot coolers. The melt/burger was on scrumptious bread, decent spice, confusing missing section of the to go container leaving an empty feeling (more than 6 chips maybe?) and for 14 dollars it is not much more than on par. From this kind of marriage I rather carne seca with a side of rustic bread from a place that has more of a unique feel. I cannot recommend a try here when Tucson has so much to offer.",oWI2rSsR1YruJX8Mu13AKA,2021-01-24 20:59:30,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,2,Al

fjX0kOdCeSFPp1hvGB9Rag,"Soft opening success! Barrio Charro offers delicious breakfast, brunch, and lunch options both for takeout and dine-in; we've ordered takeout twice since they've opened (to try breakfast and lunch) and have always been so happy and satisfied with the service and the food. The phone ordering and pickup process was organized, quick, and easy. For breakfast, we tried the westside waffle and don's encanto. The waffle is made with the tres leches barrio bread and topped with a delicious banana pecan dulce that feels so warm and comforting when you eat it. For the don's encanto, my husband added carne asada - the mesquite potatoes were flavorful and toast was nicely grilled; a filling breakfast overall. For lunch, we shared the poet's plant and armando's asada - 2 sandwiches that come with a side of refreshing salsa with a hint of spice and either tortilla chips or mesquite BBQ chips. The poet's plant is a great veggie sandwich with its roasted veggies and rosemary avocado. We liked the carne so much that we had to try it in sandwich form and felt that it was even better in the armando's asada. We also ordered a coconut tres leches which we ended up eating later in the day because the lunch was so filling - definitely recommend if you're craving something sweet and light! So excited that Barrio Charro has opened and definitely will be returning for more of their delicious food and to check out their market!",8QXAB1vREcnwBybGl6kelQ,2021-01-19 23:41:15,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Christina

It was and each bite was PERFECT! The chips and guacamole were amazing as well!! The chips were good and guacamole was super smooth and not chunky as well. It was also a perfect balance of acidy and avocado! The Prickly Pear Lemonade was the only thing i wanted a bit more from!

YSOQjSxGw3UuhvTWE0lgOA,I I am a retired Chef founder of multiple restaurants and was looking forward to visiting this establishment which is hosted by prominent professionals El Charro and Barrio bread. Unfortunately my experience was less than great! Upon arrival I waited in the doorway few minutes and finally got the attention of one of the employees and asked him why was I standing there? He didn't know what to say I asked him how do I order and he said go over to that space. The design of this restaurant is flawed! When I finally was able to determine that I could sit down after placing my order I did so. After a bit the food arrived in plastic tray with plastic cutlery! I hope this change if and when they ever open legitimately after this pandemic. Food was okay. Absolutely nothing special to write home about. This is the first time that I've ever given a negative review to any place generally I like to keep my mouth shut but this was so disappointing I. had to express my opinion.,2G_CSyf5Oze5KqHFNAPgmQ,2021-01-28 19:15:52,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,1,Richard

Went to pick up an order at peak lunchtime and stood in line while the owner schmoozed with a person she seemed to know about Sonoran Restaurant Week while ignoring the pickup line and walk in customers. She finally noticed us and called someone over who redirected us to another line to use cash?? No way! 1 star lost there. Time to put customers 1st and move more quickly to serve them! We are one of the reasons this restaurant empire has been so successful, please don't ignore us,",x-JB_DRgdnoMZOiEnW1zxA,2021-09-17 21:04:15,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,4,Alicia
T1koWG47X0mVRkk0S9T9pQ,"I came here based on the recommendation of a local friend (I was in visiting from Houston) for lunch and this place didn't disappoint: friendly cashier at the counter and delicious food with pretty generous portions.The restaurant was pretty packed when we were there. We tried to find a place to sit inside but all the tables were taken. One customer actually offered her table to us because she was by herself but we decided to just sit out in the patio, where a table had just opened up.I tried the Armando's Asada and my friend ordered the El Rio Tucson Tlayuda and both the torta and the tlayuda were delicious. Along with our meals, we also ordered some chips and guac. The bread they used for the torta was soft and the meats were full of flavor and juicy; and asd I mentioned before, it was a pretty good sized that I couldn't finish the whole sandwich because I had wanted to save some room for dessert.My friends Tlayuda was also delicious - she enjoyed every bite of it (and I obviously had a taste as well), but just like me, she wasn't able to finish the whole thing because she, too, wanted to save some room for dessert.For dessert we ordered the coconut tres leches cake and although it wasn't the best tres leches cake that I'd had (Houston has some pretty badass tres leches cakes), but it was a nice ending to our meal. If I actually lived in Tucson and lived pretty close to this restaurant, I could definitely see myself frequenting this restaurant. I'd recommend all of you who live in the area to at least give this restaurant a try once.",v_7lmS6pGGkq6n0X9EljIQ,2021-06-05 17:31:21,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Belly
5KU0ZfM5_guq5BEjOSgG5Q,"Meh. If you're into delivery or pick up, you might enjoy this place. If you're interested in eating in with a few girlfriends, then this is definitely not the place for you. They give you your food in paper boxes or tin foil containers with plastic silverware for eating in. The food was ok, but not great. The sandwiches are good but the bread is super thick. I had the pork tamale and it's really half of a tamale. Very small portion and not inexpensive. It's decorated nicely, but they only have three tables inside. I recognize with covid that space requirements impact stores, but even with distancing measures they have lots of space for more tables. Last, but not least, the front staff that takes your order needs lots, and I mean, lots more training. Not friendly. Not informed. Not personable. I won't go back, nor recommend. Lots of other cute places in town that treat you well, have excellent food, and provide a relaxing atmosphere.

The menu doesn't say that it comes with Mayo and mine had mayo. The menu also says that it comes with chips & salsa or fruit; I ordered over the phone for pick up and I was not asked if I wanted chips &salsa or fruit I was just given fruit.

While I ADORE Barrio bread, and I absolutely loved all the local/special retail they had available (sonoran provision salt, barrio bread, prickly pear jam etc) I can't recommend this place for my vegan friends. The poets sandwhich was soggy when it came out to my table...and it was frankly one of the most... bland tasting veggie sandwiches I've ever paid $12 for. I did really love the mesquite BBQ chips that came on the side... but I would really love to see better/more flavorful vegan options offered!

We're not up for patio dining yet, so we ordered take-out and dined on that deliciousness in our car in the parking lot!I ordered the Barrio Santa Rosa. Pan levain served with a crunchy, yet nice chew topped with balsamic-topped avocado, cojita, and cilantro. A lovely burst of fresh flavor!My partner tried the El Presidio chicken tinga sans mayo with fruit pico. The sandwich was large, and he said it was some of the best chicken he's ever had. He also was complimentary of the pan azteca and pico.Our son opted for the Flowing Wells fajita with fruit pico. Like my partner, he said the chicken was amazing. His sandwich was gone before we were halfway done LOL!

The tea was immediately brought out to me after ordering and I LOVED how to agave was on the side because I definitely enjoyed it unsweetened. The charred onion in the sandwich was my favorite. Delicious! If I could make one suggestion it would be to have a system in place for people waiting to order or  to go orders. The place was very packed, as to be expected, but there was a lack of social distancing towards the entrance of the building.

hF7-p92QL2UD2pBXsrtSIw,"Friend and I wanted to try this place as it seemed as though it would be a good combination of two Tucson establishments.  Friend made it there without me the week before; she couldn't wait until our date.  She said she would withhold comments until I had tasted the food.  The restaurant is really nice inside; clean and well decorated with glass-fronted cabinets along the back that have breads, etc for sale.  The staff was polite and friendly and put me at ease immediately.Now to the food.  Friend ordered Carne Asada Enchiladas;  I ordered Pork Carnitas Enchiladas.  We also ordered chips and salsa with which to start the meal.  Chips and salsa arrived with the server warning us that one of the three salsas was very hot.  The ""hot"" salsa was a sort of mustard colored liquid that was not hot at all; it did have some spice to it but was pleasant.  The red salsa was good and very mild.  The chips were thick which is not my favorite type of tortilla chip, but they were cooked and salted properly.  Our enchiladas were bland with no hint of traditional Mexican spices.  They were not rolled (no big deal) but layered as a sandwich is layered. The meat was good and there were mushrooms and squash mixed in that were almost overcooked (very soft).  A very small serving of beans and salad went with the meal.  The beans were good.  The salad was about 1/2 cup of mixed greens, so not a whole lot of salad.Neither friend nor I are fans of El Charro but we agreed that this was better than El Charro.  Would I go back?  Probably not.  It was a ""meh"" meal.  I'm a fan of the type of Mexican food one would fix at home (El Rustico) and this isn't that type of place.If I could give two ratings I would.  The second would be one star for the lack of prices on the items for sale.  I believe it is still a law in Arizona that anything for sale in any establishment has to have a price on it.  2/3  of the items for sale had no prices. We had to ask for prices on items we were interested in.  I mentioned it to one of the servers and got a ""so what"" attitude back.  Additionally there were only two loaves of bread for sale at a prohibitive $8 per loaf (we had to ask what the price was).To conclude, if someone asks me about Charro Barrio, my response will be that it's ""okay"".",teauejBc7ynvX_oBuAJl1g,2021-08-22 13:41:36,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,4,Melinda

The cookies were likened to mexican pan. Not too sugary and lightly's seasoned with maple or ginger. One was like a scone with chocolate chips. Very tasty especially with a tea or coffee. My sister had a chicken quesadilla. She said it was quite tasty. It came with chunks of white grilled chicken, cotija cheese, flour tortilla that was browned on a flat top.

zjfYEWl0gOZMP9czyCWUfg,"This is a new place that opened recently. My wife and I decided to give them a try for breakfast. So, first this is not a full restaurant but more of a fast food place in my opinion. It primarily does a takeout business but does have two tables inside. Everything is served in takeout container even if you say you are dining in.  You order from a large menu of limited items on the wall, pay than wait. The place is large as it is also a market selling tamales, breads, and pastries. My wife ordered the Waffle Westside and I ordered Carlottas Catalina. My wife said the waffle was good but very hard to eat from a small box with plastic knife and fork. Mine was ok, beans were good, potato's were bland and cold. The tamale was small but good. The eggs that came with it were the smallest eggs I have seen. Two eggs very rubbery and I ordered sunny side up but not what I got. We looked around and found their prices to be very high for what they are selling. Tamales are either $18 or $24 for a half dozen, and they are small. Their breads were all marked  $5.00. So, breakfast was overpriced for what you get. Service was good. I won't write them off and will go back in a few months and see if they improve.

WJtspBVa_z7ghGsISHHjhQ,"Barrio Charro... Can you really go wrong with this collaboration??I really enjoyed my first visit to this little sandwich shop. Decided to stop by on my way up the mountain (which was honestly perfect given the food came out fast). My partner and I both ordered the same thing - the sunnyside tortamano with over easy eggs. It comes with seasoned potatoes on the side. The sandwich was a little messy given the eggs but super tasty! Great combination of ingredients. I loved the addition of the arugula. The sandwich was quite filling so I took most of the potatoes home. Nevertheless they are still really good! They've got lots of flavor to them. Definitely well seasoned.We also got the cafe de la olla which is basically like a Mexican-style coffee; it's seasoned with cinnamon and some other comforting spices. You can get it hot or iced though I must admit there was something extra delicious about it being iced (I originally got it hot then switched after sipping on my partner's iced version). Besides the prepared foods barrio charro also sells homemade breads, salsas, drinks, and a few other goods. We know how long the line at Barrio Bread can be so having this option is pretty neat! Just keep in mind the bread options here are very limited compared to the actual barrio bread store.Overall I consider barrio charro another wonderful addition to the Tucson food scene.

JeXAU6eELZlwYd15ZaT9Pw,I tried Barrio Charro right after they opened on the weekend. They have a wide variety of local products and in house made products to choose from if you don't see something on the menu that catches your eye. We had the westside waffle that was perfection on its own. I highly suggest the waffle if you want something sweet. We also had the barrio Santa Rosa which can be found under their barrio toast section. This toast had sooo much avocado and was one of the best avocado toasts I've had. It was packed with flavor and the balsamic glaze was the perfect final touch. We also picked up some of their homemade chips which we snacked on all week. You get way more and they taste fresher than any store bought chip you'll find at the grocery store.

I tried 5 different things on the menu. At the beginning portions were generous, but 3 months later the portions changed dramatically. The place now is way overpriced, this is Tucson, not Vegas strip. You charging 15$ for a carne asada salad, that cost you 4$ to make. It has one strip of bacon, half egg, 1 tiny scoop of carne, 3 tiny pieces of avocado, lettuce and dressing. WTF. I understand its inflation.

ODcHa7X1Q5tqg3ISuVOkmg,"Updating my review after the company reached out to provide a gift card for me to try another meal here. My review remains the same. I am underwhelmed by the flavor of the food here and the prices that they charge for vegan substitutions, and honestly for the food in general, is outrageous. I'm not sure why a just egg substitute costs $4 when you can buy an entire bottle for $3.99. I will never find it reasonable to pay over $10 for avocado toast, especially when we are not in california. I do absolutely LOVE and adore Barrio bread and happily spend my $ on bread, but I will skip brunch at Barrio Charro from here on out. If you've got the $$$$ and you need options for lighter food and plant based options- it's a great place to go.

The portions were on the smaller side, as some other reviewers have mentioned, but more doesn't always equal better. Not sure if it is because of the pandemic or if the restaurant always serves food this way, but everything comes in ""to go"" type containers.

QyMXgFCK_YF6ma9WRP20sw,"WOW! I am amazed that this place has such high quality food for being a little brunch/lunch cafe. I adore chips and salsa, and they absolutely did not disappoint with theirs (and I love that it comes as a side for a lot of their entrees). I forget the name of the exact sandwich I got, but it had birria and came with 2 sauces, one subtle flavored similar to French dip, and the other I believe was the golden salsa. I was FLOORED by how deliciously moist and juicy and tender the birria was - just SO flavorful!! I've never had birria before and I wanted to try it, and I have to say they definitely have set the standard quite high. My meal was also perfectly fulfilling - I ate everything on my plate and was satisfied completely. I wasn't too full or hungry for anything else, and that's the best kind of meal of in my opinion.",wOiUjZUt31_U2AhxqlfpHg,2021-11-12 20:21:10,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Alayna
_WNef3cfggckdWXE-7fsdA,"I am so, so thrilled to welcome Barrio Charro to the restaurant scene! I have been a longtime fan of Barrio Bread and the Charro restaurants, so I knew that their combined talents would produce something particularly special. I was absolutely right! I got lunch from Barrio Charro today (their first day fully open to the public), and I am already thinking I'll get food from them at least twice more this week. First the space itself is lovely: bright, open, and airy. It has indoor seating and patio seating, as well as a small shop area with breads, tamales, sauces, and other pre-made products. Most importantly, the food is every bit as phenomenal as expected. I got the Pueblo Quesobirria Tortamano, and it was nothing short of heavenly! The sandwich is birria, queso oaxaca, frijoles, pico salsa & consommé dip on azteca bread. The birria was deeply flavorful and rich, with that perfect sweet-savory spice. I savored every bite, and licked my fingers (and the wrapper) when I was done. The chips that came with the torta were great as well -- and that's coming from someone who's not usually a fan of potato chips! These chips are mesquite BBQ, and were a great crunchy, smoky complement to the torta. The macaroni salad was also lovely, adding a cool, creamy contrast to the warm sandwich and salty chips. I was also very impressed with the service; despite the fact that there was a significant crowd, the staff were friendly, quick, and helpful. They had a good set-up to ensure social distancing was maintained, too. I was happy to see both Don Guerra and Ray Flores circulating among the patrons to chat about the menu, and once again was reminded how lucky we are to have them both here in Tucson. Their culinary talents are matched only by their kindness! A huge congratulations to Guerra and the Flores family on another smash hit!",-7qUbOVWJp2NT3f_TNuIBA,2021-01-11 19:06:16,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Betsy

The breakfast potatoes with salsa were actually really good. Typically any breakfast potato/home fries will be pretty bland and soggy, but these were seasoned well and very crispy.

It is a food coma inducing sandwich that has a nice balance of freshness to it from the pico. I expected a little more from the bread, but it's not bad. They don't give you much sauce as I found it difficult to dip my sandwich and the chips and salsa weren't anything worth raving over, but it's not bad.

We loved the welcoming atmosphere and our expectations were high going in and knowing this is the creation of Don Guerra of Barrio Bread and Chef Carlotta Flores of the El Charro/Si Charro! Restaurant group. The staff was incredibly attentive to detail and made sure to check in even in the fast casual environment to make sure everything we ordered was great and that we had what we needed. It did not disappoint, our burger, sandwich, house made chips, mac & cheese were all so good. The Tres Quesos Mac & Cheese had an unexpected Mexican flavor to it that was amazing. The burger and sandwich were on Don's wonderful local artisan bread and it was out of this world, loaded with flavor, high quality meat, and fresh veggies on both the burger and sandwich. The banana bread pudding with cinnamon-sugar whipped cream was flavorful but not overpoweringly sweet.

As it was! Then I ordered some potatoes, and Armandos Asada, and the Santa Rosa. Once I got home with my order, unfortunately I didn't get Armandos Asada, instead it was the Quessabirria Torta. Which is great too! But it was very soggy, I called back. Leo was nice enough to help get my order fixed to Armandos Asada, and I drove back to the store and got the Order I wanted.... and then Pam came up to me super apologetic, and took responsibility for her mistake which was VERY nice of her. She didn't need to be that nice and she was. The purpose of this review is to just recognize Pam's hospitality, and how sweet she was for providing amazing service even when I was a little upset that my order was wrong. She fixed my entire experience by doing several kind gestures that I'll keep to myself. But her kind gestures, and her respectful apology, Go above and beyond for me.

uPTciv33y4qRYClUl77pTA,"For anyone in mourning over the removal of the MexiPizza from Taco Bell's menu in 2020, don't walk, RUN to Barrio Charro for the El Rio Tlayudas with chicken tinga and jalapeño salsita. It's delicious, most notably for the crispness of the tortilla. And the roasted corn and pickled red onion are a nice reflection of southern Arizona style cuisine. I'm not sure of the difference between a tostada and a tlayudas, other than maybe the specific Oaxacan origination of the latter. But I'm a little confused by the inclusion of a  since the word tlayudas has been used to describe this dish long before it ended up on the Barrio Charro menu. But who cares, it's definitely worth the $7.95. Now if only it were available via drive-through at midnight on the weekends! Lol. I loved the atmosphere: a smartly styled walk-up brunch/lunch spot, with plenty of market-style choices, like many of the classic Barrio breads and of course of Carlotta's tamales. There were a few major disappointments, however: (1) The house salsa is so watery it left our table a complete mess after trying to pour it onto chips from the little plastic containers. We literally used a chip to strain the water out of it and then it still lacked any sense of the roasted flavors present in quality salsa. The cilantro flavor was overpowering. And at $5, this mess is a complete rip off. Yuck. (2) The Quesabirria Mac & Cheese had no birria in it. And really lacked the creamy cheesiness to justify the $10 price tag. Definitely avoid. (3) Armundo's Asada Tortamano was yummy. I especially loved the Azteca style bread. But the asada was flavorless. And it came so tightly rapped in paper and tape that the sandwich got completely mauled just trying to open it. So we ended up eating it with a fork. El Charro Cafe has been my family's go-to restaurant for nearly 50 years. So we entered Barrio Charro excited to experience this new evolution of the El Charro/Tucson story. But, I have to say I enjoyed the Barrio much more than I enjoyed the Charro. Basics, like bad salsa and under-seasoned asada, definitely fell flat. But that bread(!) and the crispy tortillas are amazing. So, we'll be back at some point.",BeXYw-X6AsZpD3G7OBP7Uw,2021-02-22 22:46:38,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,4,John

dJNo1nUZygm2dk93xvtQ8A,"I was really excited to hear about a collaboration with Barrio Bread because I love their (his) baked goods so much. I had hoped Barrio Charro's mercado was going to have a decent amount of bread choices, but I only saw ciabatta, baguette, and focaccia. So here is my mercado list first: chipotle butter, jalapeño focaccia, cinnamon conchita/pan dulce, tortilla chips, flan, baguette. The only thing I regret not buying is the prickly pear BBQ sauce.I'm going to start with the flan. I've not have flan this dense before. It wasn't a heavy tasting custard, but it was thick - not airy/light like a panna cotta consistency. I liked the flavor a lot though, it wasn't overly sweet, but just the right amount of condensed milk, vanilla and sugar. The focaccia was really good lightly toasted with the chipotle butter - I ate mine topped with scrambled eggs and it was pretty tasty. The smokiness and pepper mixed with the jalapeño in the bread brought a lot to the eggs, my taste buds were happy. I was also super happy with the conchita. It stayed super soft despite sitting in a loosely sealed bag for a few days. I definitely recommend buying them to accompany your coffee.Now on to the prepared foods: tlayuda viejo and a historico, centro caesar, and a torta asada Armando. All of it was super good.  The caesar was unlike what you'd get somewhere else. There was an extra element to their dressing, I almost thought the dressing tasted like caesar dressing with a touch of thousand island. Anyhow, the salad also had strawberries in it. It's not something I necessarily prefer in my caesar, but the charred onion was a great addition. When I first saw the tlayudas, I assumed they were going to be simple, but they were super flavorful with all the toppings. Lastly, the torta was surprisingly good too - yes, I made wrong assumptions about this sandwich as well. The bread was soft and the carne asada was tender, everything was tasty.I'm an instant fan of Barrio Charro. I want to try everything on the menu and next time I'm there, I'm going to buy a jar of the BBQ sauce, and then some.",d69F8wnAyCQMWuYQTEFFUw,2021-01-26 01:25:56,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Joann

Barrio Charro is opened on Campbell & Prince (around the corner from Ghini's) so fairly convenient to get to.  Seating is limited to a few patio tables outside, and the focus is more off a take away/Mexican deli.

With dons award winning bread and the Flores family recipes this place truly speaks to Tucson. I love the market vibes indoors with seating through out and addition tables out on the patio. It definitely falls under a fast casual type of eatery with ordering at the counter. A server will go d you and deliver the food to your table. Everything is served in disposable containers, which I found Kind of wasteful. Perhaps it's a covid thing? I hope that's not the case. We enjoyed the chicken salad, torta and a toast with beans and avocado. It was a lot of food for two people but we like to try different dishes. The chicken tinga torta was really good and messy to eat! The salad was very fresh and flavorful. The toast with beans was good but I found the beans were a little on the heavy side and I had also ordered it without the salsa on top and it came with the salsa. Everything was  tasty though.

Also, if Barrio Charro ever decide to bottle and sell that spicy bright orange sauce, I will cry tears of joy. How do folks just come up with stuff that is literally an explosion of flavors in the best possible way? I am both happy and heartbroken  that Barrio Charro is too far a drive to head over there daily. Cannot wait to try it again.",qmBT06S3Y9Pa_m3uDTwofw,2021-11-26 06:04:33,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Grace
IM_iegyzQW5jTmnRJ254nQ,"So this is one of my favorite new spots! There is indoor and outdoor seating and the aromas from inside are wonderful. They have breakfast, lunch, dinner, yummy desserts and a LARGE  array of beverages both alcoholic and non alcoholic.  I loved that they had traditional Mexican food but also fresh made bread sandwiches with lots of vegan options. Homemade food already made and things you can buy to take home a cook at home. Fresh tortillas....I can't describe all of what is available but you should come and check it out!",08RQ3m9TjajleexxPxwtQQ,2021-11-12 22:11:43,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Aurie

Oh, and everything else is really excellent, but you already have perspectives from other Yelpers here. Go, try the soup, and thank me later.",udPtKyc03ZrZjflpgyOqAA,2021-12-07 19:54:00,tpvHimO4BBn1QMPQL02B7A,5,Greg
