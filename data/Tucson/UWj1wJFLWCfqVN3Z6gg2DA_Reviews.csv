Jb7v2eBqQ82NjE0URsdVNw,"This place is a gem! We've had the elote fry bread, the beignets, and the duros and everything has been to die for. We come to Tucson every now and then and love staying at the Clifton hotel. We are so happy they opened up the Red Light Lounge because the drinks and food are perfect. There's no need to leave the hotel now! Even if you are not staying at the Clifton, I definitely recommended visiting the Red Light Lounge. It WILL NOT disappoint.",NBSTwJF1Y5MGBBqlEX-UjA,2020-01-02 04:33:49,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Manuela
WCtLKTEgs0LRqVq1JtSZoQ,"What a great place! Indoor and outdoor seating, nice little bar, great drinks. I had a special which was red pozole and it was some of the best I've ever had ~ I've been thinking about it ever since! highly recommend.",t1XVn9T8QMPpYwL4VKyacg,2020-02-01 16:09:25,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Ann
6Z31757rl7KPufycLFAtmg,"Here from Phoenix and I was craving a burger, last thing on my mind was a hotel meal, but I was tired and decided, why not. And OMG this burger is unbelievable. I don't say that lightly. Most burgers are delicious but to have to write a review about it. Wow! And the fries that came with it were also really good. Loved this place and the vibe.",0PRcXdM6hwnCL_2YeeyAbA,2021-02-16 04:05:59,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Brandon
Vizd1KlihS6vlEa9YdqeGg,"Pollo Verde Chicken with bacon, cheese and tomato on a buttery brioche bun is a fantastic combo. I'm glad they recommended the cilantro ranch dressing - delicious! Love this place. Such chill vibes. A Tucson gem. Great to see they're serving lunch again! It's the perfect mid day escape.",QK6iK1ChZfimfEirOEWrFw,2021-02-22 21:04:15,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Erika
ZaQPcptsmr4IOcX_Fgul5g,"I heard about this place from a friend. I had driven quite a bit and didn't know this place was right under my nose. They're currently running a Friday take out special. The first special I heard about was the Hot Chicken sandwich. I was disappointed to have missed out on that one, but I couldn't eat meat that day. This week's special was meatloaf with mushroom gravy, mashed potatoes, roasted veggies and a chocolate mousse. I arrived a few minutes prior to my pick up time. The way the pick up was set up wasn't too clear so I had several people asking me about pick up. My order was put together on time and handed to me. I asked if everything was in there including plasticware and I was told yes. I should have checked, but it wasn't in there. The mousse was well prepared, but poorly packaged as more of the whipped cream ended up on the lid than the mousse. They could have put the same quantity in a larger container as they did with the other dishes. The meatloaf was good, but not the best I've ever had. Restaurant or takeout meatloaf is a challenge because you don't really want pooling grease, but you also want to avoid dry meat loaf. This wasn't dry, but it wasn't moist. It missed the window slightly. The portion size is generous for the price. This was a good meal at a good price. I'm thankful they're doing a cool take out in the Social Distantancing time.",_6j6uCisr8DNewdBlZKAdQ,2020-04-25 15:19:35,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,4,Erick
vbgcqFK0HpwlpZMWh17QYQ,"This may have been one of the best Sonoran-inspired brunches I've ever had! We ate here after staying overnight in The Downtown Clifton, its funky hotel home, but would gladly visit again just for the food. Stone-ground masa biscuits with homemade prickly pear hibiscus jam and orange marmalade were huge and fluffy, with incredible depth of flavor from the masa.  For our main dishes we had chilaquiles - an amazing dish of chips softened and layered in red chile sauce and topped with pork, crema, avocado, pico de gallo and cotija cheese - and the sumptuous verde eggs benedict, with more green chile pork, corn salsa, and pickled peppers. Perfect balance of flavors, textures, and freshness all around!",_8bqny1lVshAV8I6TbJReA,2020-03-09 01:39:12,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Ali
rmBsORm55bFp6mvWHjWSjw,"We went in last night for Sonoran Restaurant Week - this is a meal that I'll remember for a long time!  We were completely impressed!  The space is super cozy and intimate.  Our service from Matt was absolutely the BEST!  He checked on us every few minutes, and even sat at our table with and just chatted for a few minutes.  We started with a pecan salad and a Aguachili Amarillo - a ceviche with corvina - it was spicy in the most perfect way!  There thinly sliced jalapenos and cilantro, it was bursting with flavor!  Next we had the sirloin with masa - a beautiful plate on top of masa coated in flavor - salsa and bean, cabbage - just WOW!!!   Cooked to perfection and flavors galore!  The mesquite bean ice cream was exquisite - soo smooth with subtle flavors, I could have eaten 3 bowls.  These were perfect dishes for Sonoran week because of all of the local ingredients that were carefully used, it was something really unique, and out the 5 restaurants that we tried for restaurant week - this was far and above the best!!",EAHCCgMFoJxlOPcCPQ91SQ,2021-09-17 18:28:53,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Kim

Fz-SHw26obXx33AgQoBVsg,"Spent the night at The Clifton,the hotel in which this restaurant is located,so took advantage of this convenience and ate dinner. Mexican Coke & a nice Hibiscus Margarita from the bar got it started. Food order included chips,salsa & guacamole. Chips were out of an average bag but salsa & guacamole were great. Next the elote (Mexican Corn) ribs,interesting take but not successful. Chicken Quesadilla was great,dark meat chicken cooked & seasoned nicely. Street taco Carnitas next,pork was flavorful but total taco experience was again average. Service was friendly and attentive. We paid highly for the convenience of eating where we stayed...$64 !!! Not including tip. Would not visit unless staying at the hotel.",bzxwKlQ01BxXO2jYvpOtHA,2021-11-15 02:32:42,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,3,T.E.

rxDVJWSbo7xSwC0dkLaL2Q,"OVERALLThe Red Light Lounge is a little restaurant with unique offerings and a full bar inside The Downtown Clifton Hotel in Tucson, AZ.ENVIRONMENTLow-light. Hand-curated art all around. Limited dinner menu. As mentioned previously - full bar. Indoor and outdoor seating. Plop where you like. Dogs allowed. Plenty of newcomers coming through the door... I liked their array of hats & unique pieces. What's not to like about that?SERVICEThere were times when the service was super slow, but for the most part they were amicable and efficient. The bartender was super nice. MY FAVORITE PART...The juicy, fat-flavor with the mildness of the poblano pepper from my burger.NOT SO FAVORITE PART...The slow service. Ordering at the bar.THE GRUBSo... I gotta admit. I was feeling pretty low because we had just said goodbye to my family in New Mexico a few hours before we arrived here. I filed for a divorce in October from my husband of 15 years. The drive in post-Thanksgiving traffic. Stupid people on the roads. The world today... I knew I wouldn't be able to sleep without help. So I ordered a few drinks (11/27/21). Lol.+ Margarita ($8) - was supposed to be spicy, but wasn't.+ Cartnitas tacos ($11) - my 8-year-old really enjoyed them with the green salsa+ Red Light burger (18) - comes with a poblano pepper and fries... ordered a medium rare one for me which I absolutely devoured. A well-done one for my 7-year-old. She surprisingly ate all of her burger. It was big. Lol.+ Sunset Cooler ($8)  - it was better than the margarita. It entailed ""gin, grapefruit, lemon, hibiscus, and campari.""+ Flan ($5) - it was alright. My girls enjoyed it.+ Night Cap ($10) - they allowed me to take this concoction of ""mezcal, cacao bourbon, meletti amaro, and amargo vallet bitters"" back to our room.+ 2 Sprites for the girls with good carbonation ($2 each)LITTLE YELPER'S CLUBThere is no kid's menu, but I made do with my 7 and 8-year-olds because I have always raised them to try new foods. PARKINGThere is minimal lot parking not exactly reserved for paying customers of the hotel rooms - as I was not asked what vehicle I drove. Some street spots too. TIPSOrder at the bar. Face masks are not required if you're fully-vaccinated for COVID-19.| Food: 4 | Service: 4 | Environment: 4 | Price: 3 |",SRqtqW96nDIxtDM7qc1YGA,2021-12-14 20:16:13,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,4,Jenni
J5d2X86dcriZD2l5GvhoSQ,"I just ordered the BLT online and walked over to pick it up, it's about two blocks from my apt, I only waited about 3-5 minutes if that and it was still primarily warm when I got home.  The fries with soggy, there were well seasoned and delicious!  The BLT was A1, with fresh lettuce, a plethora of delicious bacon and juicy tomatoes.  I might just get another one tomorrow!",HpCT2cMzIU9fRIO8enRnTg,2021-01-25 22:31:53,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Kala
-vy6IC8JOdxztaUqcm5XSg,Really a cute little place. Started with two ample cocktails.  We had two really good meals and the cauliflower appetizer was simply the best. We were then surprised with live music on the outside patio.   I'm hoping to go back to try the burger.,PdkQMymlcsOZkwCvaQfKAg,2021-06-22 21:01:20,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Janet
ziL7GfkTI4MCd-jDIWecaA,"Just went for the first time with a small group of friends to celebrate a birthday. Really cool vibe with indoor and outdoor options. The food (especially the sauces) and cocktails were great! You order at the bar and then they bring you your food or drink. We had fish tacos for an entrée and the olives, potato, and fries for appetizers. This is absolutely a hidden gem and the people working hard to make this place fun and delicious deserve a shout out! We'll be back!",1mKeVVX1aAFpu5-i3wja8g,2021-08-24 14:54:29,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Joel
G6fbXktHO4rW1LDMMNe5Zg,"I thought I was going to love this place, I really did. The ambiance is cool, and there's live music that isn't too loud because it's in a separate area. Bonus points all around. Shit started going sideways beyond the initial impressions. Although the hours listed on google, Yelp, and well everywhere else state that this place is open until 11pm (and we went on a Saturday night no less) we were informed when we went to place our order that at 930PM the kitchen was closed. Ok, shitty, but we decided to have a drink and figure out what to do. While we sat with our slowly made, mediocre at best drinks, we noticed food still coming out of the kitchen. I explained this away with the thought that they must have been some last placed orders trickling out. Fine. We were allowed to place an order for delivery from another restaurant and decided to stay there and eat it. AN HOUR LATER we saw food come out of the kitchen and be delivered to some people sitting at the bar. I'm sorry but what?? Were we lied to? And what was the point of that? Why be inconsistent with your hours and then on top of it allow some people to order and not others? Unfortunately this all stacks up to unforgivable and we will never be back. Sad really.",IE6x8iUDan2bF32xYR0Nmg,2021-07-26 17:22:49,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,3,Aisha
lqUGMT48IKLUgkda5VySFg,"I've visited quite a few times over the last year as well as done take-out. They've revised the menu several times since opening. With the current menu focused on Sonoran food it feels like they've finally hit their stride and found what speaks of their brand as well.  The Clifton Burger is absolutely one of the best burgers I've had in town.  Seriously. Order it. You won't regret it. Recently we tried the Roasted Poblano, Guajillo Pasta, Carne Asada Tacos, Queso Fries and Salad. Everything was delicious.  It's a feast for the eyes as well as the taste buds.  The Roasted Poblano dish was just beautiful. I wanted to sit and stare at it as much as I wanted to eat it. Full bar with a couple of beers on draft and some local So Az wine options. Craft cocktails are def a specialty.  They are locally owned and support local as well. When it comes to restaurants located inside a hotel these guys set the bar HIGH.  Wait, scratch that,  they simply set the bar high regardless of where they are located. The food and drinks are outstanding and could easily be in any high end restaurant in town.",9HVdyfrZiuz9wDaL-fwCog,2021-05-15 20:11:34,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Heather

bW2BdLNucGxu4SIBF-ai4g,"They've kept this daring place alive through the pandemic & quality is excellent! The menu is small, well thought out with fresh ingredients. Eating here is a lesson in local and regional foods! Loved the fresh fresh fresh corn tortillas.The burger was very tasty, without being too fatty. The Chipotle aioli was great and I usually don't like any heat in my salsas. Outstanding and uniquely cut fries, with the right blend of crispy exterior and soft insides. Salad so crispy, like farm fresh. We chose a chipotle ranch. A real hub, this place. I hope it endures.Fine, friendly staff, all working hard, but generous with their time, if you ask, but you gotta ask.",ccc0lzCN8Oduku7IZTHyTg,2021-05-25 03:22:25,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,Wedge
n-k1zpug0PtR_S_VMZs8eQ,"There was a time when the idea of fish tacos was ""eh"" at best then having had Chef Nico's fish tacos at the Red Light Lounge everything changed. The tacos were perfectly crisp, seasoned to perfection and dreamy. Have had numerous fish tacos since that encounter with Chef Nico's fish tacos and not one has come even close to what he has created. His entire menu is fresh, innovative takes on classics such as buffalo wings with cotija and a cilantro lime aioli. A decadent and delicious Indian Fry Bread and even salads packed with Southwest flavor. The only regret is having not made it back in yet to try the newly launched breakfast menu. Grab a spicy margarita and some fish tacos next time you're around and thank us later.",75B5WqTB0bvykiwe7r7CJw,2021-02-26 23:22:37,UWj1wJFLWCfqVN3Z6gg2DA,5,William
