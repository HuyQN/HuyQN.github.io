Vegans looking for a great, authentic-like Mexican food experience in Olde Kensington area, this up is your place. Can't wait to try all of the other vegan options!",FF1FX7U0ngERLm1G0VuDqQ,2021-04-30 23:11:42,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,5,Keith
fagHXboa32JVbGuUqwWZ8Q,"Birria taco is packed with cheese and meat and comes in a bigger than normal tortilla. It comes in 2 with a side of the consome, lime, cilantro/onion, and salsa. Sikil Pak($12) is unique and worth a try. The place overall is well decorated and spacious. Plenty of parking. Really wanted to like this place more. Food overall tastes pretty decent but it's a bit over priced which keeps me from going more and recommending.$16 dollars for 2 tacos just doesn't sit well with many people. If the burrito stays the same price, I think they can at least put bit of guac. I do think if the overall menu were priced more friendly, they could attract more customers and more would recommend their friends to take a visit. But with current pricing, it seems to be a big shoe to fill. I know it's a newer restaurant but if they could do something about what I mentioned, i think they have a lot of potential.",novFMPBgjicGHqNW0LqMmw,2021-10-21 01:45:55,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,3,Jeary
oeSxTXIb7rEIGeZiCqvpPA,I was excited to come here after visiting the Neon museum; the experience was underwhelming. Our server was less than friendly and didn't know what they were out of. I ordered a beer and my server came back ten minutes later and told me they were 86 (out). The food was okay; but honestly wouldn't recommend.,nH7-RUH4C-Smirxhp-NPKw,2021-09-11 18:05:02,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,2,Kendra

v0j31jJr1JHPzMFFWZBWhA,"Loveeee this spot so much already. Great vibe/decor, lots of vegan options, very reasonable prices. Everything has so much flavor. Indoor/outdoor seating and lovely staff. Can't wait until they start happy hour and brunch. Oh and there's PARKING - AND - a brand new sexy bike lane for easy access. All the elements of a successful center city restaurant without the pretentiousness or headache of getting there and waiting for a table.",cYBIS0ULPL4lRhZmApY5ug,2021-06-03 23:04:17,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,5,Kate

Tan-kCDLWE9SwB2U0R7Sgg,Some of the best Mexican food in Philly and the best in Fishtown. Lived in Southern California for 10 years so I got my fare share of tasty Mexican and this is right up there with those joints. Don't be fooled by some of the negative reviews. Who cares if it's in a parking lot off of American Avenue or if the waiter only refills your water three times instead of four. The food is good so who gives a shit.,izGN81PKD8__T8Px5fwVPQ,2021-12-14 23:25:18,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Michael
D8eq-PRwoR0oaYP5DZyZ8w,"Review is from brunch on 07/25/21. Based off of other reviews, you would expect to be in for quite a treat both food and service wise. The only way to explain the great food reviews is that these folks never regained their sense of taste and smell after a bout of Covid. My friend ordered a Selena craft cocktail... A refreshing sounding combination of gin, Mezcal, aperol, lemon and watermelon. If you love drinks that have no flavor and taste like nothing, then I highly recommend this. Otherwise, go with a chilled glass of bathwater... At least it will have some flavor to it.I ordered probably my favorite Mexican brunch dish... Huevos rancheros. Turns out the restaurant theme... Bland and tasteless... spans the entire menu, not just the drinks. I just assumed that they had run out of salt in the kitchen, but when I asked for some on the side, the waitress (I'll get to her in a moment) brought some over (begrudgingly) and it at least made the dish palatable. Does anyone actually taste the food that they send out anymore? My friend, being vegan... was super excited to try this place and ordered one of the vegan dishes. Two bites in (make that three... As I took one bite to confirm)... it was so bad that not even salt could save it and she left her plate virtually untouched. That covers the food and drink, now on to the service... Or should I say lack thereof. I'm certain that the waitress shows up for a root canal with more enthusiasm than she brought to our table and yet, we still tried to be personable with her to no avail. I wish I could say that the automatic 20% gratuity (a travesty) was to blame for her flat demeanor, but I'm pretty sure she just doesn't care. She brought a can of beer to the table with no offer of a glass from which to drink it (classy). A third friend of ours showed up 20 minutes after we did... instead of recognizing the new addition while at another table less than 3 feet away, she left her sitting there to go work on her frown face for another five minutes. Compliments where they are due... She has perfected the frown :( True to form, when bringing the check and seeing an untouched plate of food, she did not even ask or care if everything was alright (remember, she was getting 20% before we even sat at the table). As we were leaving, I pulled her aside and without making a scene, informed her of the poor food, drink, and service to which she responded... "" we will take that under advisement and do a better job next time"". I told her not to worry (which I know she didn't)... We won't be back!In case you think I'm all doom and gloom, the restaurant does deserve one star for the decor... It was very festive and tastefully done!Cheers (just not at Sor Ynez again ;)",ILbXNwkzETWindcxErcpgA,2021-08-03 18:52:04,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,1,Giles
rRej4Tu3oeQ5yiX9fe90eQ,"This review is for a large (10-person) family dinner prior to the official opening.In a few words, things were great and I think you will be happy here.We ate outside at a long table on comfortable chairs.  Although we were not under cover, the dining area is surrounded by a handsome arrangement of enclosed spaces that look to be useful even if it rains.As for the food and drinks, they were exceptionally good.  Inventive cocktails lots of beers and wines, and interesting non-alcoholic beverages are also to be had.As you would expect, food is plant-forward with several tasty vegan and vegetarian options.  If you like poultry and meat, you can get that too.Portions are not large but more than adequate.  You will want to share.The host came to our table several times and was rewarded with smiles and compliments.Oh yes: there is free parking.  Lots of free parking.You should go soon before its gets too crowded.",wkaYGtsC3Qt7g09kExjRcQ,2021-06-13 18:31:31,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,5,Ken
PTTjmOQfDKN4lDmz65thKA,"A bit off the beaten path but Uber no problem.  Indoor seating, some covered enough for people to sit during rain. We sat indoors.  Good margaritas. Decent salsas.  Quesadilla ok. My mushroom tacos were good but needed a fresh or acid element like slaw or tomato. Service was average; had to chase down a drink refill.",Mo1DN1grB0oZZaf1625AxA,2021-07-24 17:38:26,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Maria
TvuGAdqW-yC38Da8Qv4rWg,"Great ambience, easy parking, friendly staff but bland (and inauthentic) food that is way overpriced. Guacamole and chips for $12? Two tacos for $14? And I'm still hungry.

8EAxRcp8A0sw1ung-pHLRg,"Quite possibly the worst meal/drinks/service I've had in Philly in years. There is Nothing redeeming about this place. Nobody there cares about things like flavor, quality, ambience.  Our server was borderline rude, didn't bother to care that my plate was left untouched because the food was so incredibly tasteless.  $16 a plate that was like canned beans and boiled potatoes. Drinks that were basically dishwater. Was there with two friends, and all three of us walked out in utter disappointment.  Don't bother. Total waste of money.",4vdp3wEdXUIUbEeFBsatUA,2021-07-25 19:10:23,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,1,B

e3pGEy1mtQ-ktQyVva1c5A,"Excellent service with slightly above average food. Many of their dipping and sauces were absolutely amazing. You can dip in chips with the guac, cheeses, or salsa all day long, grab a couple drinks and chill out. The food was also good but it didn't knock it out the park it was memorable for me.  Overall a solid place to hang out with great outdoor seating.",d7xA2kRYIH0m8muwOWnsSw,2021-07-11 17:10:28,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Mony
sG08KHiJPOFyGme2FkjYBQ,"Sor Ynez, although hard to find, is a gem serving up some of the best and most thoughtfully curated and prepared traditional Mexican cuisine around. Located in a converted warehouse-space on an out-of-the-way, industrial street near Fishtown, Sor Ynez's location and menu nods towards both indigenous traditions and sustainability, and features a number of creative vegetarian and vegan dishes rarely seen in the States, like tlayudas and sikil pak, alongside the classics. We stopped in on a Saturday for lunch, and were impressed by its warm and tastefully-decorated interior, which belies its drab surroundings. We started with drinks- I had a couple of delicious and stiff margaritas, whereas she had the mimosa. For starters, we shared the deliciously fresh guacamole and a duo of salsas verde and rojo, served with delicious and fresh chips. For our entrees, she had the enfrijoladas, smothered in a rich, mole-like black bean sauce, alongside eggs and avocado, whereas I had the vegan posole. Posole is probably my favorite food, and I have had many vegan versions at spots throughout the country, and this was some of the best. Unlike traditional posole, this version was more hearty and vegetable-forward with less broth, while still maintaining the warmth and flavor of the traditional soup. For anyone looking for a fresh take on Mexican with an eye towards keeping traditional recipes and flavors alive, Sor Ynez is worth making the trip.",H4Z_Ltb32c8jmNP5bK92Pg,2021-12-06 18:50:55,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,5,Jordan
k1yImGXkXkYRbpGTnKbggw,"Sor Ynez is in the New Kensington neighborhood, in an area that is not very busy and surrounded by warehouses. It could be quite a walk for some... If you rather drive, there is ample and free parking in the parking lot.The outdoor dining area was spacious and super cute, but we opted to sit inside since it was a hot day.Sor Ynez's menu looked great. I like that they offer a variety of vegetarian options. A quick glance at the beverage menu, and I'm seeing craft beers from Mexico - not Corona, Tecate, etc, they have that too - but actual craft beers. They also have Mexican wine! Mexican wine from Guadalupe Valley to be specific. As (red) wine enthusiasts and never having tried Mexican wine before, we were very excited to try the Petit Syrah from this region. Unfortunately, they did not have it in stock. So, my husband and I ended up ordering cocktails, while our friend had the Chenin Blanc from Guadalupe Valley.For food, the three of us split a guacamole appetizer, and each ordered our own entrees of Birria tacos, Alt Pastor (cauliflower) burrito and Mushroom Carnitas tacos. The guacamole was pricey but was better than average. My husband and our friend enjoyed their tacos, but I thought my Alt Pastor burrito was just all right. It was a very dense and carb heavy burrito, with I hate to say this, zero Al Pastor flavors.I wouldn't mind coming back again and trying their other stuff. I still need to try that Petit Syrah from Guadalupe Valley!",SaYctOj-v2LNNkD4EXtZUA,2021-08-23 20:19:12,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Ju
fqUxpTZWRuqgqZKTr38hlg,"My wife, son and thought we'd try something new in the neighborhood. Drinks included a Selena (gin & mezcal), a Rosario (tequila & jicama), and Pink Guava Limeade. Appetizers of Tlacoyos (grilled corn cakes and black beans) and Queso Fundido (swapping out recommended chips for tortillas). Appetizers were flavorful and looking back enough to satisfy for the night.Entrees included the Pork Carnitas Platter, Pescado Milanesa Taco, and Grilled Flank Steak Burrito. The fish tacos were ok but maybe overpowered by the batter, the burrito really bland, the pork tasty. We over-ordered and would have been better-served by just doing the apps.The mandatory 20% gratuity is excessive and unnecessary. Each of the staff were pleasant. The ambiance feels a bit like what it is - seating in a parking lot in front of a corrugated tin butler building.  Definitely can do better, there.  $150 bill for 3 people.  At least we were outside on a nice night.",qQoJ_3_NM7sLggVO4d5hjw,2021-09-04 00:06:38,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,3,Jason

Especially good: root vegetable aguachile, heritage pork carnitas, and birria tacos, and the sopa de tortilla which was unbelievably good and not to be missed no matter what else you get.

7DqceEmtM14RxudfDt6NHw,Looks like American street is really up and coming now. Nice restaurant with ample parking and relaxing vibes. Indoor and outdoor seating. Drinks were well made and creative 8/10. Chips and guacamole were great but the Birria tacos were just ok. I guess I was expecting more authentic like food truck style. Nice place to meet after work for drinks. Would like to return to try more drinks and food :),OwsY3Fu3ZwkQQ5hTdgf62A,2021-12-18 03:01:58,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Kimberly
URgG5ozRCD-aWeRDdgTK4A,"Really tasty and quality experience! It's very spacious and open outside, with more seating inside too. They have really neat vegetarian options that taste like meat, and the famous birria tacos as well.I had birria tacos for the first time here and even though there are only two, it's very filling and rich. The guac and chips were delicious too, but kinda pricey for a small portion. It was still enough for five of us to share and have a decent amount though.Service was great, and the ambiance was excellent overall - modest but quality (at least for the outdoors where we ate). Would definitely come again to try some of their vegetarian taco/burrito too!",7nq09jiKpW9xw9J9iKUbpg,2021-06-09 02:20:40,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,4,Jinsol
7tnLhQ_8uZrdMrEUde4bKQ,"This is a weird one. Pros: It's easy to get to and it has a parking lot. It has ample outdoor seating and enough heat lamps to actually heat. And the menu is really interesting. Cons: They still seem to be working on the service (the waiter kept telling me that he couldn't pronounce ingredients before butchering the pronunciations). The cocktails were kinda awful. But mostly all of the dishes just fell slightly flat. They weren't bad at all, and some of the flavor combinations were really nice (for instance, the sweet potato tacos, or having shishitos in the queso fundido), but I just felt like everything could have been... more. I think it may have been as simple as everything being under-seasoned. So good, but not amazing.",-RZz6ZiufvAZ74HQ109IHg,2021-12-22 02:03:37,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,3,Shanda
nIU-WZDMoIMxJ5UII6o48Q,"This restaurant was definitely off the beaten path.   On American looks very deserted and desolate but up and coming.   The restaurant itself is contained within a building that is in a gated yard.  The signage to the restaurant was nil.         To the food we dined on the queso fundito, and tamale for appetizer.   The presentation was good the queso was prepared with bacon instead of the traditional chorizo.  It was extremely greasy but the flavors were there .   The tamale was a generous portion but doused with crema.   We opted for entrees of the quesabirria and the pork carnitas.   The quesabirria was good can well stuffed and served with add ins onions and cilantro along with lime.   The beans were not served with tacos so we added on.  These seemed bland to our taste.   The pork carnitas presentation was nice although it wasUnder seasoned and dry .  We also ordered two specialty drink one being the Frida which was a spin on margarita with charred corn.   The drink was extremely sour and lacked a sweet balance.  I'll pass on the floating corn in my drink next time.         To the reason I gave the restaurant three stars.  The location and signage.   We were the one of only 2 people in the restaurant.   The check came 119.00 this included gratuity.  I understand the state of the world but gratuity is based on service and I want to be in control is the server Is worthy of customary 20% or even more.   So I'm my opinion it's a bad business practice to determine the gratuity for your customers ... allow them to decide if your staff meet the mark.",2d6yD5a0lbmkuWFQ52CuJQ,2021-11-14 14:05:40,xOeBBrc2l5OfjX_cY4bIvA,3,Fran
