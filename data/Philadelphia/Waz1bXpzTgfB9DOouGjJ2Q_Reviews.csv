It is South Streets best kept secret for a sushi spot with the freshest fish and hands down the BEST poke bowl I have ever had.The midori fried noodles are out of this world amazing.Great for a quick place to grab a bite or hang out on a date, love this spot.Definitely try it out before it blows up and there is a line around the corner.",6uzKiRxKIB29PWKNBjK23g,2022-01-10 17:29:38,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Jonathan

DKa7iSctPzwcI9HybgofyA,"The sushi spot we were planning on going to was closed and we ARE THRILLED about it!!! Midori was fast and kind and made us some FAT sushi. Good size pieces of fish and the chef special rolls we tried (angry dragon, crunchy dragon, and midori classic) were  delicious!!!! Cant wait to be hungry again so we can go back",hSb48vPe1FSocETAvu-vHA,2021-05-19 21:58:07,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Rachael
PWncvozBC4B-ZghZJNsbsw,"I got the beef ""teriyaki"" bento, which is tare sauce if you have ever been to Japan. Excellent. It's a large serving or tender beef, rice, a California roll and an actual green salad instead of iceberg lettuce with one slice of tomato. It also comes with a couple of pieces of deep fried gyoza and miso soup.I was in Japan several times. It's not 100% AUTHENTIC but it is definitely worth every penny if you're looking for a full meal.The interior of the place is also great. Very clean. The service was fast! Definitely recommend!",2IFJzxhyqIiXOdClKiI-Jw,2021-07-06 08:25:06,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Caroline
ewN9LYO9EDiwo_yeMfMHyA,"If I could give more stars I definitely would! My first time ordering here and I was a little under the sun today but when my food arrived, LET ME TELL YOU! I only ordered the chicken katsu bowl Bc I've been craving it for a awhile. HOWEVER! The rice was so fluffy and the bowl overall had so much flavor! The chicken itself? Oh my goodness the best! It was so good I'm pretty sure I finished pretty quickly.... It was so good I left myBowl spotless. And now I'm in an even better mood. I seriously recommend this place to other first time customers! You seriously will not regret it. Me on the other hand will be ordering more often!",tsnDQiRCO6lNysoSYD9eRQ,2021-09-09 18:48:49,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Marlene
ru_AypA_bcSFQOc3lepR0w,"I love this new Japanese restaraunt. It has great food selections, the restaraunt is clean and warm, and the staff is friendly. I had the lunch bento box on this visit. It was plenty of food for $12. The miso soup has lots of tofu and seaweed.  The broth was rich and cloudy. The bento box had five items. The sticky rice was cooked just right. It was soft and slightly sticky. I enjoyed the marinated beef and salad. The rolls were small but the bento box still provide plenty of food for my lunch tummy. I also like the small subtle touches such as the background Japanese music, wet towel at the end of the meal, and custom made wooden booths. Hopefully, you will also enjoy a delicious meal here. Let me know how your experience turned out.",k3Xxkt-rplj8-kDpwQ33MQ,2021-11-08 15:05:12,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Ninja
UeOjHg7LW7c8MoW_vooXiA,Hands down my new favorite Japanese spot in the city. All the food was extremely fresh with huge portions. Best kani salad I've ever had. We ate in the restaurant and the presentation was lovely.,KfmXPelFjVzOT1HFfLklsg,2021-06-24 20:20:57,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Caroline
BrUwxcSvVTRJTUUbgJHgZw,"Took a chance on a brand new Sushi restaurant in the neighborhood! -unassuming, friendly with an extensive menu  beautifully presented and each piece as delicious as it looks! Don't go for the atmosphere but go for the very special service snd tastes! Wish I had photographed the rolls! Artistic and yummy!9",t1m6B0xupcPCK_w2yBHb9g,2021-05-05 02:18:29,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Ellen
V0V5J9qpobv2yzFDcCOyug,"The first impression upon entering was that the restaurant was clean, serene, and spacious, with a warm and welcoming staff. Great care to maintain health safety is apparent with masks, sanitation, etc. I have only been getting the lunch specials in the afternoon and have been so happy with the quality, quantity and the prices. I look forward to a long and continuing relationship with this restaurant.",yggVtSTbiA_9DU5DuxO7DQ,2021-09-22 23:00:17,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Cheryl
4XQweUVO0VmJ7QaLH1GbZg,"This is my new favorite sushi spot! I didn't think to take pictures, so I only have a photo of the roll I had to bring home because I was so full. I had the eel/cucumber roll, crunchy dragon roll, and spicy tuna roll. My pic is of the spicy tuna roll I brought home. We also had the spring roll with shrimp. Service was excellent. We didn't realize it was a BYO until after we got there and sat down. Next time I will definitely bring some beers. Our server was nice and gave us plenty of time to decide what we wanted. As other customers left, we watched as the staff quickly cleaned the table, and then placed a little ""sanitized"" sign on the table afterwards. Delicious flavors, fresh fish, quiet and peaceful setting. If I could give more than 5 stars I would!",YKrMaknUqQWdWRPF7gTy9A,2021-06-01 01:23:54,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Aly
pB52Qznt6zWd6bfsV2eFWQ,"Glad I tried it :) Food comments: I ordered the sushi lunch special with the Uramaki Salmon (4) & Zengarden Black Rice roll (4), the Salmon Delight special roll (4.5) and Mix Tempura appetizer (4.5). The mix tempura was my favorite thing, as the batter was so light and lovely & the vegetables seemed very fresh. The sushi was decent. The lunch rolls were small, though I recognize I did the lunch option. The salmon delight was pretty good, not as wowing as some special rolls but I liked the sauce & the toppings. Other notes: very fair pricing. All this was $30! Also, I really liked their menu. It seemed authentic & was vegetarian friendly. All in all, it's not my top pick for sushi in the city, but it's a spot I recommend supporting & plan to revisit!",ZRWBe6VPvJIndTYVWWQHvw,2021-11-09 22:44:30,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,4,Rachael
QNufR1p3149A0WGeg-Lmgw,"Happy to have another sushi place in the hood! Everything was so good and service was quick, easy, and friendly. Our favorites were the pork fried noodle, the spicy kani salad seared tuna twister roll, and the calamari salad. Definitely a nice addition to QV/society hill.",sBxDrYvsmarh0QI12hnZBA,2021-05-08 00:24:46,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Chelsea

LQCThGFve75Kd7F9JDN8-Q,"I hadn't had sushi since -- how long was quarantine? -- about that long. Well maybe once but it was disappointing. So the stakes were high for Midori, a Queen village newcomer with just 6 Yelp reviews. Cut to the chase: it lived up to any dreams I had about sushi. And I'm already plotting my next visit.It's a sparse but clean space with 3 private booths, a banquette and a few tables. With one other table filled, I felt comfortable, but would have if it were busier as it's airy and social distancing-friendly..The service is prompt and polite and they have ""call buttons"" like on a plane or in a hospital in case you need to get the staff's attention.There's a lunch menu with tons of $10 options give or take, including rolls plus miso and salad, or hot dishes like teriyaki, and a poke bowl which I HIGHLY recommend. The tuna was red, fresh, and plentiful. The avocados perfectly ripe. Rice well-seasoned. Spicy mushrooms delicious, and something that looked and tasted like mango, but I'm uncertain (and don't care) if it was. Perfect umami.Give this new small business a shot -- I think you'll be happy.",MB24FupUiQDWXzKO76rgCA,2021-06-29 16:50:53,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Stefanie
P8cbZuT4PLP3MTQUxpB7rQ,"Just as I'm about to move away from Philadelphia, a cute sushi place opens a block away. Of course, right? Reasonable prices, super sweet restaurant workers, and lots of variety. They have a large array of food from ramen, poke bowls, sushi, and cooked Asian food.I got the California Nigiri special which has salmon, tuna, eel, and shrimp nigiri with a California roll. I wasn't a fan of the tuna as it had a bit of an after taste, but it might have been just that cut. I also got an order of inari sushi! Super yummy iykyk. Hope this place makes it! At least hopefully this year is better for restaurants!",bfJpL3-nDiqgfmZgUpjPiQ,2021-06-11 20:31:59,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,4,Kelly
dBYSTsQlYi7qRCe-nJ-YSg,"This place hit it on so many levels that it made me happy spending my hard-earned dollars there.  Went in for lunch yesterday and ate 6 people's worth of sushi.  Started with the seaweed salad which was surprisingly good.  The sushi was spot on.  The Hotate (scallop) sushi should be on everyone's order.  So dang good.  The salmon sushi was some of the best I've had.  The Otoro was riducouly fatty and delicious.  All of it.  And to cap it off, the people who work there have an amazing story.  They are Burmese.  But they have a special relationship with a Sushi Master so you're getting an amazing melding of two cultures.  Their kindness and humility make it that much more impressive that they can back it up with some knockout sushi.  Plus it's BYOB.  Need I say any more?  Just go get yourself a bottle of sake and bathe in the sushi goodness.  I can't be happier I did.",fYdL25AOgPmGpQAEtedyYg,2021-09-21 18:55:05,Waz1bXpzTgfB9DOouGjJ2Q,5,Danny
