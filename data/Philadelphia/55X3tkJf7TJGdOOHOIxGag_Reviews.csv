0it9zyCpUuMClOCzYflS5g,I am so glad to have a place like this in the neighborhood. Normally I have to go to china town for quality good of this caliber and now I only have to go a few blocks!,0BlvR97oKmnHffrF2bohcQ,2022-01-13 23:00:25,55X3tkJf7TJGdOOHOIxGag,5,Harris
V4gKtmTfLKbpWRrFyhcZUA,"sushi was great - very well presented & delicious. portions were generous and fairly priced - the shrimp tempura roll was big with 8 pieces, absolutely no complaints. the atmosphere & interior decor was really nice and authentic. they don't play obnoxious music and the lighting & atmosphere all around was great. only recommendation is to have some speakers in the dining room for the piano music that was playing as it was very quit inside and definitely could use it. i live in the neighborhood, will definitely be returning next week.",rWwFfWO8I9ybkXVC5YI4Zg,2021-12-29 02:48:16,55X3tkJf7TJGdOOHOIxGag,5,Eileen
jh-bjeH-dU8D0F96R6_1cg,Salmon and tuna rolls were super fresh! The chef special roll was huge and full of fish! Perfect for date night or easy take out. Welcome to the neighborhood!,Qc8gaANGOwIctSCyfeVh6w,2021-12-22 00:34:24,55X3tkJf7TJGdOOHOIxGag,4,Lauren
9z81dC7ZKYjkqrVS7t0MGA,"Fantastic new addition to the neighborhood! Indoors is classy and cozy, but I got takeout. Menu is very expansive, plus really great sushi combination deals and lunch boxes to save some money. Ramen looked great but we stuck with just a selection of signature maki rolls to get a taste for everything: white dragon, black dragon, rainbow roll, kamikaze, and spicy tuna. All were absolutely delicious, but that kamikaze was the thing of dreams (a punch to the face of flavor and texture) followed by the white dragon in close second (subtle, but powerful). Rainbow roll was great, but I still favor the classic rainbow from Ginza. Prices are decent, to be expected for the quality of what you're getting.Staff is also very friendly. Will 100% be back!",OExmdhEdcKHQQqXrv6ftTg,2022-01-09 01:29:25,55X3tkJf7TJGdOOHOIxGag,5,Andrea
oWpUM3nrLuFWyKTT1uH8ZQ,"(Cash only! As of Dec. 2021.) Very charming restaurant and a great addition to the neighborhood. The spicy ramen actually have a kick to it and we really loved that. We only ordered one type of roll. Not like mind blowing but it was pretty good. Compared to the sushi, the spicy ramen definitely won our hearts with the rich flavor profiles. Will definitely come back and try more!",nJHR0MQIRtjloQ8m9QmK0g,2021-12-31 17:21:48,55X3tkJf7TJGdOOHOIxGag,5,Tao
