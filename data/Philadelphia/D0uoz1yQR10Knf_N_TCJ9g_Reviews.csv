vI5G7GbCKvohNTCZXytPQg,"My boyfriend and I enjoyed a delicious Labor Day brunch on Musette's opening weekend. We each ordered a meal (he went for the Camembert baguette) but we decided to each take half of the others, everything was so good! The atmosphere in Musette is great, too; it's a bright, airy space with beautiful artwork and great music. I can tell it will be an oasis on a rainy or snowy day.",BsqwepMtUQXu4PD0fXYqIQ,2021-09-17 12:49:37,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,Hannah

My husband and I have been here a handful of times since they opened and have tried their smoked salmon tartine, fig and ricotta tartine, and apple and fig baguette. Everything has been incredible, light, and fresh. The café is nice and airy and staff is very friendly. So happy to finally have a café like this in Fairmount!",hzbBWjDTqHZhmzChFfnlsg,2021-10-13 13:27:45,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,Lindsay
97rMeuov96OjajjVQAv0SQ,Super grateful to have a place like this in fairmount! By the vast demand and lines out the door you can tell that it has been ovedue. The coffee that I got had spoiled milk. It is not the first time I have ordered a coffee with spoiled milk and I recognize it can happen but when I sent it back and asked for a new one the barrista told me that the milk was definitley not spoiled. Okay....I guess. He begrudgingly gave me a new coffee and I put the milk in myself from where the help yourself things were and round two (without the spoiled milk) was better. It has a nice serene atmosphere and is a nice addition to the neighborhood.,Te3BwftEFN8C9WxImhfM_g,2021-10-24 12:56:55,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,4,Gwendolyn

U0IepwS3YI3V-ADXYCkq6A,"Musette has officially put Brown Street and Lucky Goat on notice with their great atmosphere and coffeeshop vibes. I stopped by this place after Sunday morning yoga and I'm so glad that I did. The atmosphere in here is great and it's so new that the crowds haven't showed up yet.I got a cappuccino and we split some Avocado Toast and a Fig Jam, Apple, and Brie Baguette. They do NOT have a full kitchen here but they have an interesting selection of cold sandwiches (no meat on the menu). The sign says pastries, but all we saw were a few bagels and biscotti (to be fair we were there late in the day).The best thing about this place was the cool ambience they have created. The Beatles' White Album was playing and there were a few people working on laptops inside. Even the bathroom was well appointed and fit the rest of the place.I am very happy to welcome this place to my neighborhood. I expect great things from them in the months to come!",mkYghhPmRxn8sEBnK0M_iQ,2021-09-14 02:30:26,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,David
lQloe-47NIRkDpuSaiq4Sw,Finding hidden coffee spots is always on the top of my daily to do this and Musette did not disappoint. The latte was good but the tartine was even better.,_b7sWPWtHFHMrIaq_4PCHQ,2021-11-19 17:46:09,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,Sherry

Highly recommend the salmon tartine and the croissants!! Keep up the good work Musette :)",XlVntnyF4aseX3Xun7VfeA,2021-09-27 18:17:41,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,Adrienne
KE1bBt_0DGk9lCVUZnC_Fw,We stopped in on our way back home to Seattle and really enjoyed the breakfast. Being able to order a simple baguette and butter is awesome. Drip coffee was good and so was the espresso. Would definitely recommend this place to coffee lovers. Staff was friendly and quick as well.,jTo144b5jtvsoryXtAqT3A,2021-10-25 14:30:01,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,5,Shibumi
T4tnRpgSCNsth3Td7MvrWg,"I've been here a few times now and have not had amazing experiences.Here's my breakdown:Pros:-It's close to my apartment-The food is pretty good, but kinda pricey-They have indoor seatingThe cons:-They seem to be completely befuddled by tea. They couldn't tell me what kind of green or black tea they had. Not a huge deal, but then when I ordered a back tea they gave me green. Another time I ordered a chai latte and it took 20 minutes because they forgot to make it. When I finally got it, it was basically warm cinnamon milk. Not worth 6$ with tip.-They turn the wifi off on weekends-My partner's coffee was burnt afIf you're going for food, Musette is nice. But if you're looking for a place to work or get a cup of tea, try Lucky Goat. I was so psyched to have another coffee shop in the neighborhood but I don't think I'll be going back too often.-",ZhKZgeJmc0hycijP64iBrg,2021-12-04 17:16:00,D0uoz1yQR10Knf_N_TCJ9g,3,Andrea
