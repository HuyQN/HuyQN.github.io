ClXJ-p6aO0HBRlRcDp_h6A,"This new neighberhood gem was highly recommended by multiple friends. What better place to take a girl on a first date than an awesome sushi bar for some quality fish and saki.  We ordered the calamari, oysters, ramen without broth, tuna and salmon sashimi for appetizer. Everything was phenomenal.  For the main course we decided to try every single sushi roll except the one which was just veggies... this was top quality, and really fresh sushi, tops in the city.  Couldnt finish it all, and took some home for the next day.  The service was outstanding and our waiter was awesome.  Cant wait to come back again.",9LxZfxsQFp4NdB6j4jFMmg,2021-10-01 03:03:55,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Eddie
w6vL6MCfyAsq3sHapgYFRw,"Restaurant recently opened so was excited to try. Went with my daughter who has a shellfish allergy. Waiter was super helpful letting us know which dishes she should avoid. The food was super fresh and very good. My only complaint - the space is small, so it's loud. Like really loud. I read this in another review, and it's accurate. Also there was a stereo speaker directly above our table, and we felt like the tables next to us were shouting at each other to be heard. Hopefully they can figure out the acoustics, I'm looking forward to going back and being ableto talk to my dinner partner.",FBwxGDCPGbk4y3xUb5GJdg,2021-10-08 00:19:39,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Laura
8bZ_xVlP1w0GgcMg9xRHKA,"This place is pretty good for being so new. The atmosphere is very cute, and I'll give a pass on the service for being so new and crowded on one of their first weeks being open. We tried the duck onigiri, which was just ok - very dense. The short rib bao was very good, the Bao was soft and the duck was cooked well with lots of flavor. The mushroom gyoza was probably the most flavorful vegetarian gyoza I've ever had. We also got the toro scallion roll - the way Yanaga does his sushi was interesting, but I don't personally love it. The rolls are thick with a lot of rice and the fish is a little ground up - with that said, the flavor of the roll was a 10/10. We also got the salmon chirashi which had a lot of flavor, but you couldn't so much taste the salmon because there was a lot going on in the dish. The west coast oysters were also flavorful and tender. The disappointing part of the night for me was the soupless ramen. The noodles were cooked well, but the menu doesn't indicate that the Tantan Mazemen ramen is essentially in a thick peanut sauce (it just has ""peanuts"" tagged on the last part of the description""). There were so many other flavors in the dish that I wish you could taste more of, mostly the meat. It kind of just tasted like noodles with a mealy peanut sauce. Overall, I thought the meal was good and I'd love to come back. Drinks were good too.",OxfnFHyedpprZLVMOSEATw,2021-09-26 11:31:24,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Emily
KiBA-apVKB84eRfiuO7p1Q,"Newly opened Japanese cuisine in Fishtown. Very clean and modern decor. Calm and friendly environment. Service was very good.  They rely on food runners who bring out and briefly explain your dish.  Nice touch because it creates an increase in efficiency. They have a nice beverage menu. Includes wines, craft cocktails, sake and additional Japanese elixirs. They recommend that you order about 5-6 items at once.  They will come out once they're ready. The food menu is very good.  Lots of very nicely prepared Japanese rolls, sashimi and ramen dishes to suit your palette. Overall I had a very nice experience here.  They still have a few things to button up, because they are new. I felt there were too many people working, but that's no a bad problem to have these days!I'm looking forward to coming back.  Give them a try!",-_Lfm5bztNCYXaBmrqY7tA,2021-10-25 21:36:40,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Ray
uPzhYVJY8OjC05Kh3h52aA,"I was so excited to get Japanese in the neighborhood and had seriously high hopes for this place considering all the hype and accolades of the chef, but we were pretty disappointed with our dinner. The atmosphere is great and our server was lovely, but the food just wasn't great. The menu is small, a selection of appetizers,  sushi rolls, ""chirashi"" bowls, sashimi and ramen. We got the pork gyoza, two rolls - the toro scallion and sea bass, the hamachi sashimi and the pork mazeman brothless ramen. We ordered two drinks too - one was great (the one with the name about the L train) but the other one had ""duck washed"" whisky in it which is apparently a thing right now but was a bit weird. The sushi rolls came out first (actually, all our food came out before our drinks which was a bit annoying) and they were one roll  per plate and 5 pieces of sushi per roll. First thing I was immediately disappointed by - why only 5 pieces? Why not at least an even number so you can share evenly? That was minor however compared to the lack of good proportion of fish to rice. The toro roll had basically a ""hint"" of toro, and the sea bass roll also had an insufficient amount of fish. However, my biggest complaint about the sushi was that the sea bass roll was COOKED. anyone who loves sushi and isn't vegetarian is most likely looking for raw fish, because that's what sushi is all about. if you're gonna put a cooked roll on the menu, it should say that. Next the hamachi sashimi arrived, and it wasn't terrible or anything, but it seemed sort of like thinly sliced fish with some kind of bland syrup on it and some chunks of peaches that were very difficult to pick up with each slice of fish (which is what I think was intended). again, not terrible but nothing to get excited about. Then our dumplings and ramen came out simultaneously. It wasn't coursed well, but again not a big deal - but it was weird we still hadn't gotten our drinks. The ramen was basically noodles in a peanut sauce, which is what we expected, but it really lacked sophistication in any way. It was almost like Dan Dan noodles (Chinese, think Han Dynasty) but with better noodles and no spice. There was very little else in the bowl, a few pieces of bok choy and a soft egg (not flavored in any way). However, there was one large piece of delicious char siu and that was great. But that wasn't enough to save the dish, and honestly didn't really go well with that kind of ramen. Finally, the pork gyoza were really great! I was amazed that of everything we got, this was the best. The pork was delicious and they were cooked perfectly, crispy and topped with something unidentifiable yet also delicious. At the end of our meal the restaurant was getting close to closing and people kept trying to take our dishes away before the food was gone. There was a feeling that they were all looking to end the night. Sadly, the dumplings and drinks aren't enough to bring us back. We were left feeling like we ate too much ""filler"" (rice, noodles) and not enough substance for the money. We might stop in for a drink and a snack sometime, but they really need to up that sushi game if they want to compete in our fair city that has so many other wonderful options.",TdrlUOK1UdjDomWhrTKJ3A,2021-10-03 12:34:09,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,3,Rachael Gray
a9Z1MN3dM5XsqI0Uy5V2ow,Fantastic spot. By far the best sushi experience I've ever had. So happy this opened up so close to home.Morning. Loved the shrimp tacos and my japanese whiskey cocktail. Oh and the oysters and all drinks are outstanding!!,qccuRh_V0j_o1DYqxYQ9LA,2021-10-01 20:16:38,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Tal
iJ3RPS8PuDpUZVYuT7skGg,"*MEDIOCRE*3.5 StarsI've looked forward to trying this place when I found out it was opened by Kevin Yanaga, who worked with Starr and Schulson. The place has bar seating and table seating, first come first serve, no waitlist. Would recommend going early and not during peak dinner hours. Menu is relatively small, but with a decent variety of hot and cold foods. Price is not bad as well, average $10 per plate. All dishes are small tapas style, great for sharing. Overall, there are hits and misses. Cold food was a lot better than hot food. DINNER* Toro scallion maki - MUST GET. This roll was my favorite. Very comparable to toro you would get at Omakase. Fresh, quality, and they did not skimp out on the amount* West Coast Oysters - MUST GET. My 2nd favorite item. Although the oysters are small, they are so fresh and texture so buttery, basically melted in my mouth. They clean it very well too. Would recommend gettingHamachi sashimi - pretty fresh yellowtail sashimi. Sauce is a bit on the lighter side compared to other hamachi dishes I've had.-Shrimp tacos - pretty good. It was unique that the taco shell is actually a fried wonton shell. I liked that it had a large piece of shrimp in it-Karaage - pieces were huge but not as fried crispy as other karaage I've had. Batter was a bit think and kinda soggy -Duck Bibimbap - basically duck meat mixed in rice in a shape of onigiri. Didn't really get much duck.-Snow crab maki - snow crab didn't have much of a flavor. Kind of disappointed -Tantan mazemen - would not recommend getting. The sesame flavor of the meat sauce overpowered everything. No depth of flavor and it wasn't that spicy. *VERDICT*I probably would not go back again unless someone ask me to, and if I did, I would probably just stick to sushi.",tvG1daVmZtkOKKaAOMAE0g,2021-09-18 23:00:59,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,3,Lucy
_u7DnGAlDOS8eXYlL4kRNA,"I enjoyed Yanaga a lot. I am from Japan. I am sincerely hoping those who don't know Izakaya well would not mess up with this place with ignorant reviews & comments when Philly is rampant with wanna-be Japanese izakaya that use too much ketchup, mayo & smelly repeatedly used cheap oil. To my surprise, locals here call such questionable ""Japanese"" dishes delicious and lack thereof bland. Mmmm.... Once again, I enjoyed every dish here.",Ma-zs9aXZwr-e3DgIXoRLw,2021-12-23 08:01:20,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Nobuko
G_bCzhU4nUA0mcWzXWVAfg,"We did the fest of the seven fishes. It was a pretty interesting take on a classic Italian tradition. While I think the regular menu would be more interesting to try out, it was nice to try all the variety offered by this special menu. The sides were pretty good- bok choy, umami cake, shishitos, and wasabi rice. The hamachi tasted perfect. The octopus robata was underwhelming in my opinion. The salmon rice crisp and oishii shrimp tacos were very hipster concepts (I wasn't a big fan of either). I loved the Chilean seabass onigiri and the bluefin tuna chirashi.",RJvNtUnoe4-bJO20mzGMGA,2021-12-31 16:29:04,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Payal
S_4154JnonzzMmUNHO_hnA,"When we think about celebrations, IZAKAYA BY YANAGA is always our first option and it never disappoints. From the starter to the dessert the quality and tastes of everything was outstanding, my chicken karage,salmon chirashi,and mushroom gyoza might have been the best meal I have ever been served. Service was delightful and very professional. 10/10",P4AH4oEApJLwPjcmnXhlqA,2021-10-01 19:08:10,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Kevon

MLPR08XYUpUUEID6kSBHlQ,"Really enjoyed my dinner at Izakaya by Yanaga the other night. Service was attentive and the vibe was cool- very busy! Interesting menu with lots of unique food and drink options.The drinks were delicious- tried the East meets West and the Meet me at the El and both were well balanced and boozy. Loved the duck onigiri, hamachi, wagyu beef skewer and the tuna rice cracker. Didn't love the mushrooms and thought the bao bun and spicy salmon were good but not mind blowing. We also tried the sake flight which was 4 shot glasses worth of sake for $40 but the sake was so smooth it was delicious.Definitely recommend checking it out if you like raw fish but it's not cheap, so just be ready for a bit of a splurge!",VClMTiHXXYlLNjalD3N4XQ,2021-11-21 13:44:02,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Melissa
B7Vl9_hoG_ehC1QFsymz9w,"Good drinks but rather mediocre food. Started off with ordering one of every item from the small plates section to get a broad perspective. I'd say more than half was underwhelming and none was memorable. Read one review that recommended the fatty tuna roll which was just alright. This opinion was shared by the party at the table. Venue is pretty but quite dark. It's big so can accompany a large party and there is a nice bar area. I think this place is nice to hang out and have a few drinks at the bar but For me, I'll maybe skip the food unless I'm super hungry.",d7xA2kRYIH0m8muwOWnsSw,2021-12-25 16:20:00,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,3,Mony
6r8avHm1XyyUetNZjj5k9g,"My girlfriend and I had been meaning to try this for a while, and we were not disappointed. With the izakaya servings it wasn't as easy to estimate, and I accidentally over-ordered, but it was definitely worth trying all the interesting dishes. We ended up ordering a lot! The highlights were the Toro Scallion Sushi Maki, Shrimp Tempura and Snow Crab Chirashi Sushi, and the Snow Crab Sushi Maki. I would recommend ordering 4-5 dishes per person, and would strongly recommend most rolls in the Sushi Maki portion.",nz_BLNZV5ddqNV4jglxKKg,2021-11-02 00:41:22,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Alex
zmLNAhNWcmiZNT2_wOI6Ig,"Needs work. The sushi rolls are too bland, too simple. It's not hard to make sushi rolls more interesting, especially makimono. It seems this place is trying to focus on the quality of the fish, which obviously isn't bad but it's too simple. It leaves much to be desired. The pork gyoza desperately needs dumpling sauce. Dumplings aren't hard, but the lack of flavor is a major turnoff especially pork!The drinks are great though. I was impressed with the bar program and the Japanese whiskey cocktail I ordered. My advice is to promote the bar program and add more to accompany it. Our server was friendly, but a little pushy. The restaurant was mostly empty too at dinner time as well. Some changes are definitely warranted. Obviously this place is new and could still improve. Start with better sushi or nix the sushi program altogether.",nnImk681KaRqUVHlSfZjGQ,2021-12-04 23:17:56,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,3,Carlos
KRXgwV5k4WikEKzkLZgf4g,"Very glad to see IBY open up in the neighborhood, so much so that we've visited twice now in the short time they've been open. I do think there are definitely some kinks to be worked out and the menu has some hits and some misses, but hopefully as time goes on those kinks will be worked out. Jammed out on both visits to A Tribe Called Quest playing on the speakers and the decor is intimate and cozy. The service was great both times as well. We were able to walk in and be seated right away at 5:30pm on a Friday and the following week had a 9pm reservation on a Saturday for which our table was also ready right away. The cocktails were delicious and they have a nice selection of beer, wine, and shochu/sake as well.As far as the menu goes, the following are definite hits and misses:HITS: Mushroom Gyoza (this is really a standout dish), Vegetable Tantan Mazeman (incredible chewy handmade noodles and lots of toppings), Oysters, Sushi Nigiri Special, Curry Short Rib BaoMISSES: Karaage Chicken (huge pieces of fried dark meat, not my jam), Hamachi (fish itself is great, but dish is not flavorful), Sushi Maki (we tried 3 different rolls - ALL of them had way too much rice and creamy sauce)Overall, more like 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up because I like the vibe there.  Probably won't rush back with options like Royal Izakaya 10 min. away, but a nice neighborhood addition.",JeH9Q7i0blYtCNMC45SXPQ,2021-09-27 19:11:15,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,4,Rachel

The atmosphere was cozy and  cool, And our server was fantastic.  We ordered some kind of a rice dish stuffed with duck, short beef bon bon, shrimp tacos, and oysters. As far As sushi, we had toro scallion, blue fin, tuna, salmon, and yellow tail.  This fish was so fresh and tasty and top quality that my wife had to order another toro scallion.   Everything was amazing and went down great with the sake. I cant wait to come back again.",qm-uEKbmeAQonNxRLiR9DA,2021-10-02 23:24:29,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Jeffrey

This is some of the best quality fish and sushi We ever had. We ordered a bottle of Saki so we have not tried those delicious looking cocktails that we saw on other tables, but they looked really awesome. Our waiter was so friendly and informative about the menu and helped us pick the items to our liking.  Cant wait to come back and try everything else!!!!",5jKScvMqxW_rzd0D8xgX1A,2021-09-05 12:57:50,VG4yVFNX7B-iONzZlLd-Fw,5,Mike
