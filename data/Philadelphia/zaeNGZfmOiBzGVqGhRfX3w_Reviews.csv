T0D7e6-717UK5mu8-dOUDg,"Small selection of quality wine by the glass and snacks. What I most love is the cozy, dimly lit, 2nd floor space and welcoming staff. A great hideaway off South Street.",KmlAcSovYEagg_UOBb_nSw,2019-12-13 20:07:00,zaeNGZfmOiBzGVqGhRfX3w,5,Starred
fqnmlXQbkRB3nlZVHkzEFw,"An excellent new wine bar above The Good King Tavern opened by the same owners. It's meant to recall a French wine bar in the Loire Valley and it really hits the mark. The wine list is absolutely fabulous. Really interesting by the glass list with mostly french wines but a few other sprinkled in. The bottle list here might be the true gem. It's just big enough to be deep but brief enough not to be overwhelming. All of the bottles are reasonably priced and they have some wonderful offerings. The owner pointed us to an excellent Cabernet Franc from the Loire and it even featured a bottle from my one all time favorite wineries that is rarely on menus Bichi Wines from Baja. Any wine program that features Mexican wine is getting top marks from me. The food was very good as well- bar olives were delicious and visually appealing. Charcuterie board was very good also and exactly what you want with wine. Overall the bar has a fun, cool vibe and the offerings are exceptional. I will go again and again.",voKLemNxYVYLOPKvBsU6Lg,2019-10-27 15:25:27,zaeNGZfmOiBzGVqGhRfX3w,5,Jeff
Uc-9q_U9NSp8x6rldiMFZg,"Was excited to check out Le Caveau Wine Bar as the reviews seemed very promising.Le Caveau is located above the Good King Tavern, and the entrance to Le Caveau is only a few steps to the left if you are facing the Good King Tavern. Both are under the same ownership.The wine bar was intimate and the music was chill. I loved the ambiance of this place.As for the wines, the variety for wine by the glass was limited; however, their wines by the bottles go on for pages and pages. It's like they're encouraging you to buy their bottles. The markup on these wines are definitely more than what you expect from this area, like x3.And I get it, these are natural wines and natural wines cost more to make, but the taste didn't do it for me either. My husband and I split a bottle of pinot noir from the Loire Valley and it was just okay.Food wise, the menu is again limited, and the portions are small. This place is more of a pre/post dinner drinks spot. The portion of the charcuterie we ordered to pick on included a few slices of prosciutto served with a basket of bread, which was expected at $8. It would have been nice if the bread was toasted though.Overall, we had a nice time at Le Caveau, mostly because of the ambiance. Service was good too. I would love to come back again. Hopefully, next time they can add more variety to their wines by the glass.",SaYctOj-v2LNNkD4EXtZUA,2021-10-17 22:20:26,zaeNGZfmOiBzGVqGhRfX3w,4,Ju
NE9u9WxIZvysj59zlvxocg,"I enjoyed the look and casual nature of Le Caveau.  It's what I was looking for in a wine bar, a place to chill and try some wine that I hadn't had before (specifically French wine in this instance). There were a couple of glasses that I found that I liked, and a couple that I really didn't like.  I was disappointed that they didn't have more offerings by the glass.  If I recognized the bottles, I or came in with more people, I would have been more comfortable venturing into the bottles.  I enjoyed the snacks that were offered.  The comté cheese and olives that we had went well with our wine. Though I was disappointed with the bread that came with it, it was surprisingly tough. The music was a bit overpowering for the small, intimate look of the bar.",cIVmIJD7nIiEcVGamfBoVw,2021-07-22 19:01:19,zaeNGZfmOiBzGVqGhRfX3w,3,Jay
zsbjMPgRHk72Sjk1pxkUAA,"Love the vibe here. They could offer more wine by the glass though, there's plenty of wine bars that are upscale that do and at the bottle prices are not super attractive unless you have friends you're going to share with. What they did offer by the glass was quite good though.Definitely room for growth!",nnImk681KaRqUVHlSfZjGQ,2021-12-06 03:23:02,zaeNGZfmOiBzGVqGhRfX3w,4,Carlos
