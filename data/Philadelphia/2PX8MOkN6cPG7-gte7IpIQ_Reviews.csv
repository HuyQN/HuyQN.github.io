Everyone we spoke to was nice and we thoroughly enjoyed our food! I had the salad with goat cheese, mandarin oranges and pecans. I also got an iced coffee. We shared cheese fries. so many of the salads, sandwiches, and soups sounded great and I wanted to try so many of them. Will definitely come back here!",aWcq9zSmUMbCTGyfrSAoLw,2021-12-04 19:39:52,2PX8MOkN6cPG7-gte7IpIQ,5,Amanda

Food was yummy - we had the chicken salad , French fries ( perfectly crisp and not salty )! Our daughter has the grilled cheese and she ate 3/4 of the sandwich (which is great for her). Looking forward to coming back and sitting in the nicely spaced out back sitting area.",UfZgfIem7NYKZE0ZhazvyA,2021-10-23 17:12:08,2PX8MOkN6cPG7-gte7IpIQ,5,Jill

X_6Bsf5hLNa0jf7XIFUKiQ,"Mimi's is a new casual eatery at the top of Chestnut Hill with a very nice outdoor eating and drinking area.  It looks to be a good place for lunch or a snack or a light bite to eat. (A couple of friends have enjoyed a meal at Mimi's).   Now being in the USA for Thanksgiving  this year (rather than being back in Austria as usual), I decided to host a couple of friends for Thanksgiving dinner but to order out.  One - I wouldn't have to shop & cook in what would be a busy week for me and second I could support a local business.  I chose Mimi's as somewhere I saw a notice that they were offering takeout Thanksgiving dinners.  This review is based on that experience. My overall impression was that every thing was ok - not exceptional at all but def not bad.  Pick-up was easy and when I got home I unpacked the meal.  I was immediately worried about the portions for many of they items as they were in pint containers and would have to feed three hungry people. (The turkey portion was def for three people!)  I also couldn't find the soup which I thought was included in the dinner but obviously was not.  The portions turned out to be just enough - possibly because I augmented the meal with two appetizers, bread, and an Austrian noodle dish as well as dessert.  I'd like to see their portions for two people (except for the turkey) and see how much they vary from what they gave me for three people.  Everything tasted fine but no wow except everyone did love the salad with the goat cheese, cranberries, and walnuts...and the turkey was nicely cooked.  The weakest dish was the stuffing which to us had little flavor.  I excused myself from the table and took it to the kitchen and added some diced apples, chestnuts, and different seasonings which made it much tastier.   I will not be ordering a holiday meal from Mimi's again .... especially after I saw pics on Instagram of two different friends"" takeout Thanksgiving meals from the Acme and Fresh Market respectively which were much more ample in size, with more courses .... and cheaper.  I think Mimi's should consider at least adding one of the following three items to their dinners - rolls, soup, or dessert.   That would better help justify the price  because except for the turkey I realized I could have easily put a green salad, green beans, stuffing, cranberries, and a potato dish together for a fraction of the price.  (I've just never cooked a turkey which would be the problem for me.) I'll def go back to Mimi's at some point to eat as it looks very nice with a great outdoor eating option .... and I live close by.  But I won't look to it anymore for a holiday dinner.  Still I'm glad to support a small local business during this time of hardship for restaurants.",8EMU7d4pCkdqUnvlIW40CA,2020-11-30 14:16:10,2PX8MOkN6cPG7-gte7IpIQ,3,Jeff
MUo4Kn5nmTR0CHS_BpkSNQ,"Great little breakfast and lunch spot with perfect outdoor garden atmosphere. Totally redone from previous owners. Order from the counter and a server will bring to your table when ready. Food was fresh, tasty and came out quickly. I had the grilled tavern ham and Brie on sourdough and my husband had the chicken salad sandwich. Both came with pickle and chips. The second time we called in 2 breakfast sandwiches to-go. The eggs were nice and fluffy and the bacon was thick and crispy . Order was ready for pickup in 10 minutes. This may just be our new favorite little spot.",oGikug3t7DTaw8jQQqnuNA,2021-10-03 17:16:17,2PX8MOkN6cPG7-gte7IpIQ,5,Moira
