JhG_GgsjOULIV-X6Eeho2g,"Was excited to finally try LMNO and it did not disappoint! Would skip the guacamole next time in favor of the chips dipped in the ensalada mixta. SO GOOD! It was a chopped salad with tomato, jalapeño, chickpeas, and cheese in a creamy cilantro tomatillo dressing. We were between a few different apps and our server recommended this salad over the other options and we were so glad she did! The chicken tacos were amazing! I usually don't like corn tortillas and they wouldn't allow substitution for flour, but these were not your average corn tortilla. They were thick and pillowy almost without the grainy corn texture and the cheese melted into them perfectly. Would recommend the margarita pitcher but not the tres leches cake. The cake was topped with random stuff that looked and tasted like cereal. The listening room experience was fun to check out though we didn't stay long. We added ourselves to the waiting list before our meal and our spot was ready by the time we finished.",BPctreQAlxlXTCNdRfdG-w,2021-12-18 17:22:12,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Stephanie

lj8IvLir3p9ymVrRcCHYrg,"We recently had dinner at LMNO. Reservations for 6:30. The music was so loud that we literally had to shout to be heard by the other in our party of four. Obviously all of the other customers were shouting as well. Not only is this unpleasant, but in the times of ongoing covid transmission shouting increases significantly the risk of spread of covid. We will not be going back to this restaurant.",tFhpGNLBeAG38r1RctsRWA,2021-12-12 22:44:37,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,1,Susan
tbuM_fa4mtuNaW7RqW9wRw,Fun big space for drinks and food.  It is a Stephen Starr place so the quality and guest experience is there. Bartender super friendly and well versed on menu in order to make recommendations.,M2YZJ6mwd1kde5qcXFANPw,2021-10-24 20:53:46,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,5,Louis
FB_kqRmz7XuqTIJouWcVQQ,"Was very excited to get a reservation here. I'm a big fan of Starr restaurants for their consistency and excellent dining experience; El Vez, parc, etc.We had the guacamole , oysters , and a few other items from the taco selection. Generally speaking flavors off on all dishes. Strangest combination of flavors on the oysters I have ever had. Crackers with salsa... not sure what to make of it. I wonder if anyone from the executive team has done a tasting of the menu. Maybe an off night?Service was good, drinks were fine.",tGVSgT5yZ_cryIznp0FDWA,2021-11-22 23:02:46,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,2,Tim
tCzciGz9k2Jxs3U2qg07CA,"Dined here 11/6. Made a reservation through an alert I received from RESY. Prior to receiving this alert there were no weekend reservations for the month of November.This place is super sexy chill. There is a collection of provocative sexy art work on the walls. The music was vibey. Our server Dana was good, she was familiar with the menu and provided us her recommendations providing details and answering our questions very accurately. As you can see from the pics my companion and I ordered a little of everything.My favorite dishes were the dirty veggie tacos & the cucarachas. The tacos were very well seasoned. They had mushrooms, quinoa, parm, queso in a blue corn tortilla. Crispy on the outside {chefs kiss}. I asked for a side of guacamole with my tacos that I did not receive. The Cucarachas are fried shrimp hot sauce butter and lime. The temp and the spice are in fact HOT. So so good 10 out of 10.I sampled the smoked tuna Asada fries they were delicious as well I wish the temp would have been a little warmer. My companion has does not like cilantro and they came with cilantro shreds on top. (Not mentioned in the description on the menu)My salad was more cheese than salad but nonetheless good. Red snapper include bites and an additional piece of fish underneath. I have no complaints and highly recommend this spot. I actually have another reservation for later this month. RUN, don't walk.",vJ3YiIUVwhshFBpQDRJhPQ,2021-11-08 20:25:27,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Chris
IfDoYweVxjEosje2sfGKMA,"I was really looking forward to dining here. I arrived with a party of 5. Unfortunately, we were late due to cancelled Ubers, but they were accommodating and sat us quickly despite this. We ordered all of our food and drink at once since it took a while to get attention from our waiter. We received a side of esquites before anyone received their drink which I thought was very odd. When it comes to the food, the tacos are good but for the price it's pretty ridiculous when it comes to portion size. The dirty tacos are actually not tacos at all, they are quesadillas. My two friends who ordered them were extremely disappointed. The carne asada fries were good but the meat to fries ratio was lackluster. Overall, the food is tasty but it's not worth the extremely high price point. And to top things off as we were leaving two of my friends went to go use the gender neutral bathroom. They chose to open the only vacant one (unlocked!) to find a man masturbating. We all left hungry and two of us left traumatized as well.",evSTPfN2RjZwKhLIWRp7fg,2021-12-22 04:51:43,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,2,Jordan

6OW68KIfoc34eeMoFvqm2Q,"The place felt like an overpriced gentrified neighborhood restaurant. The food was OK, nothing special. For example, my 2 small somewhat bland tacos w. no sides (rice, beans, yuca fries, anything) were $18. This valuation is shocking where anywhere you go to get a taco it ranges for less than 5 dollars. Mexican food should be and has always been affordable in my experience, especially where there is no special inventiveness or fusion. The oysters were an unique hit at the table. Other problem we had was with the cocktail menu, which allows you to choose your spirit & they average $14-$30, plus your base health juice for $3, you can end up with a single drink costing you $20+ easily. Why not have an established cocktail menu.. it just seems like an easy way to trick patrons into spending more. Outside patio and hidden bar are a nice touch though.",UJgWjy5SUbwFDHl3uvdYMw,2021-12-13 15:12:42,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,2,Yeraldin
LtRWTC30cegZy2VmhGV53w,LMNO IS THE BEST! The staff is great cuz they give you food! The staff also all have personalities.

MuVA_tJ8vtkNvtTZjmGuMA,"Must try: birria tacos, pescado, Mariscos tostado and the frozen mango margarita. All were delicious and done very well! Pescado was de boned and grilled beautifully. Mariscos was mixed fresh seafood ceviche on a crispy tortilla with a hint of spice. And the birria tacos are always a fave, cheesy and delicious with a yummy consommé for dipping. we opted to get a variety of different tacos, tostados and apps to share then the grilled veggies and fish to split for our entree and it was the perfect amount of food. Easy and shareable portions. The drinks we're all delicious with a wide ride of options and customizable to whichever spirit you prefer.",hRz-qBm7Nnl6TAZNfC0-nA,2022-01-13 16:44:50,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,5,Alessandra
-n4xni_aRZB2uK5p8DyZuw,"Lots of outdoor seating and a well decorated inside. We enjoyed our meals, however, we found the prices to be a bit high for what you got. My tacos were great, but for $18 I got two tacos with no sides. A small side such as rice or even chips/salsa would've went a long way, at almost no increased cost to the establishment. We also split two appetizers that were very enjoyable, but again, seems to be overpriced. I had a beer and my girlfriend had a cocktail which she really enjoyed.Would recommend as a nice meal out, but be prepared for a larger than expected bill (and possibly leaving hungry).",QF3KEqW1bj1sw-VDOOoojw,2021-12-08 03:28:45,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,3,Geoff
8O4rDNUkxFwHfrj-2Mgmwg,"Surprised to read some of the bad reviews on here. I've had two separate meals here about a month apart and both were great, also to note we did come on a Thursday night and not a weekend both times with minimum 4 people. We ordered a bunch of plates to share both times so maybe that is why no one left hungry. While some of the portions are a little on the smaller side I felt like some of the other things we ordered made up for those. I would note that there is one seafood thing that is quite similar to the other but the price of one is like double the other and other than the difference in seafood the cheaper option was just as good. Highlights for me were the lamb, grilled veggies (shocked), vampira tacos, and the tuna tostada thing.",4BSKXV3QMeDQKqoOthvZng,2021-12-18 17:05:01,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Heather

XgmtD8vxsbOsV6bIF0QfjA,"A friend and I tried LMNO tonight and it was fabulous.The vibes of this place are awesome. It's spacious but cozy, lively yet intimate. I felt happy just being there. Our server was super friendly and explained both the drink and food menus thoroughly.For drinks, we ordered the spritz and the frozen spicy mango marg and both were delicious. For food, we got the birria asada fries, gringa dirty tacos, carne asada vampiro, and esquites. Everything was good but the fries felt like the star to me. I found the portions to be perfect -- definitely tapas style but far more generous than Spanish tapas spots in the city.I was a little apprehensive after seeing some reviews, but it seems like the usual hiccups of a new spot (none of which I experienced tonight). Everything was great and I will definitely be back!",GKVw9mKHEok-Phr3Yc-fTg,2021-12-17 03:22:29,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,5,Brittany
Tzbd2zZiiDs0QDygfhOwDg,"A new find in Fishtown!Was initially intrigued by the restaurant's proposition as a restaurant/art gallery/bookstore/music venue. While the latter aspects are not as apparent, the restaurant has a great interior (and exterior) vibe that's both classy and modern - it felt like we were dining in an art museum.The food itself was good, but not great, particularly for the steep prices. We got the pineapple & shrimp coctéle and Marisco tostada to share. The coctéle was a pleasant surprise, accompanied by 3 different sauces (recommend the chili sesame oil) and plenty of saltines and corn chips. The shrimp was fresh and the portion was larger than expected.The tostada, topped with raw seafood (which we did not know when ordering) was a bit disappointing. The fish was fresh but the portion was small for $19 and by the time the dish was served, the shell was soggy. Did not try the drinks but the menu looked cool - you can build your own cocktails.Overall, a good place to vibe and catch up with friends but would not go there just for the food",K_Zj7KV0O0vuhsIJ1INMdw,2021-12-06 18:22:43,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,3,Amy
RLGQsCeZzprIvxJaS8ZCPw,"Revise: Let's be honest, I was really excited for this reservation. I came with 4 other ladies for a fun night out. The ambiance is cool, but the price is insane for what you get. The location isn't the easiest to get to, but that doesn't bother me for a good meal. The service left so much to be desired.   Our side of corn came out before our drinks. Half of our meals came out 15 minutes before the rest. Incredibly high prices for the food you get ($18 for 2 underwhelming tacos, $24 for a sad plate of waffle fries with hardly any beef barilla). The portions are so disappointing for the price point. We had to go get food afterwards because we were all still hungry. On top of that, my friend and I went to the bathroom to find the 2 gender neutral stalls. One was locked and one was vacant. We opened the vacant door to find a man jerking off with no shame. It was traumatizing! Will not be back",0sPxAl-PQeRTOkd99KD_GQ,2021-12-15 00:48:56,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,1,Karina
6pwRoo8pd0JwcNQMIEbXhw,We came here for dinner. The restaurant is huge. They have a nice outdoor bar area as well. As you can imagine the service was incredible. The food was good but it was extremely heavy. Heavy and fat and well and things like that. This is an interesting take on Mexican food that I personally think is overpriced and I think it's not worth the price. You can get really good tacos for a fraction of the price elsewhere. The oysters came with some interesting sauces and some of the combination of the ingredients just didn't make sense to me. It was different but it was still good. I think if you want to go there and try it you can but if you're just looking for some good comfort food you can definitely go elsewhere.,rxgoHeIus7ES4cGrg8DUqQ,2021-12-07 00:09:07,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Tashalee
7JS25NFziCLKVRk0OzIVpw,"First things first, the music selection was on point! Absolutely perfect The good vibrations here are something you can feel while entering the space, which was clearly intended by the designers of LMNO. The attention to detail is something to experience and admire, not only in the ambiance but the staff as well. With a welcoming, but not over bearing feeling, we were able to casually walk in and sit at the bar. Our main bartender was ready to go right from the start regardless of the new-ness that comes with the restaurant biz. He asked us if we had any questions about the menu, which was unique in navigation from any other but I was determined to figure it out myself. I chose the Our Daily Veg cocktail with mezcal as recommended and was impressed by the knowledge of Mezcal in general. It was my one and only question ""what exactly is Mazcal?"" You'll just have to come and ask for yourself ;) my date chose a beer on tap, served cold and just as expected.Long story short, we loved everything about it. Note on Our Daily Veg Cocktail, fresh squeezed juice, pickled vegetables and fermentation: wether or not that's your thing, definitely give it a try. It has a deep complex and delicious flavor while also having your taste buds generate more questions. I can only imagine reflects the rest of their cocktail list. It was late so we casually popped in for one drink, knowing we would be back for more.

tS5maDgQfIo1SaVkZxz7ug,"Beautiful space! But the food does not match up with the ambiance.

773PDKkJrNPlc896VfzL0Q,"LMNO is gorgeous - large on the inside and outside, and super stylish as expected.  The concept of listening room, art gallery, event space and restaurant is executed quite well.  The customer service was on point.  Our initial reservations were for outside, but rain was forecasted that day, so the hostess called earlier to let us know we could dine indoors.  It seems like a missed opportunity to have all of that outdoor seating without some sort of roof cover area - maybe that is still to come.  The drink menu can be somewhat confusing and misleading with the base of the drink listed in one area at one price and then all liquor add on options in another section.  These can add up pretty quickly.  With tax and tip included, expect to spend about $20 per cocktail - quite steep, and I chose the cheapest options, they could go up to $25 and $30 all in, if you choose some of the more premium liquors.  I enjoyed my first cocktail, but found the second, the spritzer, to be tasteless and bland.  The food is also pricey.  The dirty veggie taco was delicious.  As a vegetarian, this was pretty much my only choice, aside from esquites as a side, and a roasted vegetable side.  In this neighborhood, in 2021, it's a little surprising that they are almost completely cutting out their vegetarian (and vegan) potential customers.  Because of this, I am unlikely to return.",KFFIyUxC0TQjx__OYlmhnA,2021-12-12 19:15:07,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Natalee
ZFv6q15rJpQUMafDJRVEWw,"Overall, I liked LMNO! You walk in through the patio and indoor/outdoor bar. It was raining when I went but it looks like a nice place for an outdoor meal. The tables are a bit odd with the checkered pattern, but it's this interesting sort of minimalistic vibe. There's a lot of good seating. Sort of like booths, tables, bar stools, and single seats around the kitchen. On to the food. I can't remember what it was called, but we got what was basically the birria beef loaded waffle fries. It's nice because they make sure the fries have toppings on almost every one. I will say that the cheese had a very nothing taste but the beef was suuuuper good! Then we shared the veggie birria tacos. Those were actually divine! It had kale in it, as well as mushrooms. The drinks were also very good. My friend got a coffee cocktail (which I tried) and it was super tasty! I got the frozen spicy mango margarita. Also good. But what throws me about the menu is that you pick your own booze. It seems like a good idea, but it's very overwhelming. The one thing that put me off was the service. The waiter staff was a bit much. Incessant water refills. And our waiter asked me how my taco was while I literally didn't even have a bite yet LOL. But I would maybe chock it up to this place being new and perhaps them being eager to do a good job. Very friendly, but maybe be a little less hands on.",Bu71U6VCJCrdzsI5v_LYNA,2021-10-17 22:08:48,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Lane

2eiCiZKN2Tfl60VBLJOABw,"Have been wanting to try here for the two months they have been open. It was 10000% worth the wait. The ambience inside and outside is perfect for friends night out or date night, there's plenty of bar seating both inside and outside. Large open restaurant inside with contemporary dress casual vibes. Their cocktails are great - large selection of spirits. We ordered the birria, pollo asada tacos and the Tostada Vietnamita - ALL were incredible. No matter how full you are after dinner, you also need to order dessert - the grilled corn cake is unlike anything I've ever tasted before. Covered in blueberries and vanilla ice cream. And their tres leches is some of the best I've ever had!

m7GNHNegUW40FIZpS_HBFg,"With all of the Mexican places popping up everywhere in fishtown, I didn't have high expectations for this place but I was pleasantly surprised by the awesome decor and music. My cousin ordered the lamb shank and I watched in awe as it fell off of the bone. I ordered the chicken tacos and was initially disappointed that it didn't come with any side dishes but after seeing the perfect sizing of the tacos I had to put my foot in my mouth because the tacos were enough and they offered everyone who ordered food complimentary nachos and tortillas with the housemate dipping sauces. For drinks we ordered the ""nice and easy"" which is perfectly named and mixed. We had 5 each.

TFzAlBphiVVjzl7mSjoHcg,"So we stumbled upon this place last night and it was so fun! They apparently just opened and this was their first weekend. The stars are for the drinks and service at the bar alone. We had reservations at Suraya so we did not eat. Overall the vibe is unique and fun. It's modern but down to earth and has a bit of a party vibe to it in a good way. They have a nice outdoor space and a large indoor space with an exposed kitchen. I looked over their menu and they seemed to have a wide range of mexican/baja California type of food. I appreciated coals going in their kitchen as well as a rotating spit for their al pastor type tacos. All good signs. We had incredible drinks including a frozen mango margarita that tasted like it was made in-house 100% and fresh. The rim had a spicy salt that balanced the drink nicely. We also had a mezcal based cocktail that had a green juice in it made with nopales, tomatillos and poblanos among other things. We were so excited by this place we cannot wait to go back and explore their menu.",HZ0uRG1Xct8eltExJ6_jZQ,2021-10-10 13:37:01,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,5,Carlos

I definitely recommend the coal roasted oysters and the birria tacos. The waffle fries seem to be the staple app, but I found them to be pretty underwhelming especially for the price of $25-30 depending what you get. The cocktails are interesting -- we tried all of them and most were good, but I would like to see a few more options with a little variety. Service was great. No complaints there. I do think they are overpriced for what it is,  but won't stop me from going back.",7OcQbFZ9kRYgDD5BUos0Wg,2021-10-25 17:35:26,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,4,Joseph
F0v1qDc2A6SNbkMtrhVuAg,"A very important TLDR: most of the ""dirty tacos"" are not tacos at all and the portions will send you home still hungry and bummed that you made the trip and spent the money. How do I summarize my experience at LMNO? The best way would be to call it a major let down. After reading and hearing rave reviews, I made a reservation a month in advance to celebrate my birthday and the birthdays of a few other friends. We were so excited to have snagged a table for 5 people at 6:45 PM. Two of our five arrived first and grabbed a seat at the bar to wait for the rest of us. We got stuck with two cancelled Ubers in a row and ran late, but luckily the staff didn't hold that against us and seated us once we had all arrived. Sadly this was the highlight of the evening and things were very downhill from there.We ordered cocktails and beer, esquites, birria asada fries, and assorted tacos (each person got their own order). The corn came pretty quickly, earlier than the drinks. For $9, it's a pretty small bowl of corn. It does not come with chips. The fries were delicious but absurd to pay $24 for a very small portion of French fries. The birria beef was not even a large enough portion to justify the price. This was not enough for five people to share. My gringa dirty taco was described as ""similar to a quesadilla"" by my waiter when we asked. When it arrived, 10 minutes after everyone else's tacos, I realized it was similar but smaller than any quesadilla I've ever seen. Essentially a small portion of cheese, meat, and not noticeable pineapple between two taco tortillas, for $14. While I acknowledge there is a labor shortage and issues with access to ingredients, that does not justify how disappointing this experience was overall. If you read Karina E's review then you know how the night ended... we left hungry and traumatized.",gWZETLPu_ihAtLOYtrm0mw,2021-12-16 13:20:06,zvvl3c1FO3O3BZdhusficA,1,Gabriella
